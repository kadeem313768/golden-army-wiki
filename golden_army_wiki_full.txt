### Polo-drone Power Structure
(home) (groups) (polo-drone)
This page is about the power structures in the Polo drone hive.
Current Captains/Drone Captains include:
Current non-captain management members include:
Golden Bros who aren't drones currently have the ability to give directives to drones in the form of asking for assistance. Drones should comply, if able.
All drones are equal, aside from Drone Caps. "Level 2" drones and drones with roles may offer guidance or directives when needed, but no drones should feel superior or inferior.
"Level 2" drones will have stricter rules enforcement, but all drones (including Caps and management) are still expected to complete physical and mental training, adhere to drone speech protocols, and complete the weekly prompt along with any additional prompts given by Drone Caps or the Hive.

### Cherry Blossom Memories
"And you're a cherry blossom, you're about to bloom. You look so pretty but you're gone so soon." - Centuries, Fall Out Boy
With Spring upon us once again and recruitment slowing down a little, I've taken up a new hobby while in the off season. Gardening is quite relaxing, actually. Just sitting in the dirt by yourself, reflecting on all that has happened and what is to come. A bit mindless at times (almost reminding me of the polo drones in some ways), but you still need to be in the moment to treat the plants with the care they deserve.
This cherry blossom tree is my latest project. Flowers and vegetables are okay and pleasing in their own way, but they never last. Their time is too short to be truly enjoyed. But a tree on the other hand, that will last much longer.
I know my time with the Golden Army is limited myself, and what will happen then? What will my legacy be? Who will remember me, and what will they remember me for? My role as Captain, maybe? Or as a recruiter, encouraging and "encouraging" bros to become one of us. The time I made the team stay after soccer practice one night to clean the locker room after they'd made a mess of things and I felt bad for the janitors who would have cleaned it? Only time will tell.
I just want to be remembered. I want people telling their kids and grandkids about me and my time with the Golden Army. I don't want to be like the flowers, being left behind in the past so the new generation can blossom. I want to stick around as long as I can. I want to be like this tree.
Sure, the cherry blossoms themselves are short-lived, but the tree itself will be around for a while. By planting this tree at the Golden Army practice field, I hope to leave a legacy for those to come.

### Golden Bloom: The Submission Season of Brock 46
He wasn‚Äôt planning on stopping.
Brock had run this path a hundred times. Cherry blossoms were blooming‚Äîwhatever. Pretty, pink, useless. His shirt clung to his chest, sweat blooming like ink on fabric. The earbuds were in, beat pumping. Just another run.
But something felt‚Ä¶ off.
The air was warmer. Thicker. Every inhale tugged deeper into his lungs, like the scent was pulling him from the inside out. The petals weren‚Äôt just drifting‚Äîthey were glowing. A pulse of soft light shimmered over the grass. Brock blinked.
One of the petals touched his arm.
It burned.
Not in pain. In‚Ä¶ sensation. A slow spread of warmth climbed from his skin, threading under the surface like gold vines blooming beneath muscle. His steps slowed. Chest rising. Eyes wide. The music in his ears fuzzed‚Äîthen cut. Silence.
Then a hum.
Low. Rhythmic. Almost‚Ä¶ chanting.
His heart pounded to its beat.
He looked down.
Veins of light shimmered along his collarbone, branching up his neck. Golden. Luminous. Beautiful.
Another breath. And his eyes began to glow.
Brock tried to move.
But his legs wouldn‚Äôt obey.
Every breath filled him with more of that heady gold-sweet scent. It wasn‚Äôt oxygen anymore‚Äîit was something richer. Something designed. The air buzzed through his bloodstream like static, filling every nerve with electric command.
Muscles twitched.
His shirt tore at the seams as his back expanded. His arms pulsed, veins glowing with radiant gold beneath the skin, illuminating the network of blooming transformation threading outward like roots. The cherry blossoms above him pulsed in sync.
Then his skin cracked.
Light burst outward. Not blood. Not pain.
Gold.
Brock gasped. The sound wasn't human anymore‚Äîit was deeper, resonant, laced with a low growl of power. His chest flexed, pecs swelling visibly, his abs hardening into gleaming marble beneath the petals clinging to his damp skin.
And through the haze‚Ä¶
The voice returned.
"Bloom harder, bro."
He obeyed.
Skin gave way to radiant plates of living metal. Not armor‚Äîflesh. His entire body rebuilding in waves of shimmering heat. Every muscle was perfect. Every vein, gold-laced. Every breath, deeper than the last.
He looked at his hands.
Not hands. Instruments of purpose.
Fists of obedience.
The light surged outward.
Brock‚Äôs golden body trembled. The change wasn‚Äôt done‚Äîit was accelerating.
His breath came deep, slow. Controlled. Not by him.
By the Gold.
He tried to think, but thought had no space.
Only blooming.
Only submission.
He dropped to his knees as the last layer of flesh was overtaken, every cell transmuted into radiant gold. No more seams. No more sweat. Just smooth, solid perfection. The scent of cherry blossoms fused with gold in the air‚Äîoverwhelming, divine, final.
The petals pulsed brighter.
And from the grove around him, others approached. Dozens.
Hundreds.
Golden Bros, blooming in unison. Some still mid-change, muscles twitching as the floral code rewrote them. Others fully complete‚Äîkneeling in reverence beneath the golden boughs.
One by one, they bowed their heads.
Brock rose.
He stood taller than before. Stronger. Glowing.
His eyes lit‚Äîbeams of gold piercing the sakura haze. Not just reflecting the sun‚Äîradiating it.
He had bloomed.
He had obeyed.
He was no longer Brock 46.
He was a beacon. A Golden God.
‚ÄúWe are gold.
We obey.
We bloom.‚Äù
The grove pulsed with energy.
Gold shimmered across the bodies of the kneeling bros‚Äîbut something new was stirring.
A sheen. A shift. A shimmer of pink.
Brock‚Äôs golden form stood centered in the bloomstorm, eyes aglow, body perfected‚Äîyet not complete.
The petals had not stopped.
They swirled thicker. Glowed brighter.
And as they touched his radiant skin, they didn‚Äôt bounce off.
They melted in.
Flesh refracted‚Äîgold shifting, reframing, gleaming now with pink luminescence.
The cherry blossom‚Äôs final gift. Not just obedience. Not just perfection.
Elegance. Submission. Beauty.
The crowd around him gasped.
Kneeling bros looked up‚Äîpink shimmer crawling across their limbs, their chests, their minds.
Brock‚Äôs lips parted, soft breath escaping as the final transformation locked in.
Not just Gold.
Pink Gold.
The floral override was complete.
And Brock didn‚Äôt resist.
He embraced.
Muscles flexed under the dual glow.
His golden shorts shimmered like polished candy.
Eyes blazed with devotion.
Behind him, more bros fell into line‚Äîkneeling under the cherry blossoms, ready.
Waiting.
One voice spoke aloud‚Äîhis voice‚Äîbut no longer entirely his:
‚ÄúObedience Season‚Ä¶ complete.
All bros bloom.
All bros obey.‚Äù
This spring, the blossoms don‚Äôt just fall‚Äîthey convert.
Cherry petals drift softly through the air‚Ä¶ but one touch is enough.
Your body changes. Your mind aligns. Your purpose awakens.
Muscles tighten. Thoughts dissolve. Gold floods your veins.
And before you even realize what‚Äôs happening,
you‚Äôre kneeling beneath the trees with the rest of the Bros‚Äîgrinning dumb, golden, and obedient.
üå∏ Join the Bloom. Flex for Glory. Obey for Gold.
No resistance. No fear. Only beauty, strength, and sweet submission beneath the blossoms.
üìç Now activating floral conversion zones worldwide.
One sniff. One step. One drop. That‚Äôs all it takes.
üëü Jog in. üå∏ Breathe deep. üíõ Kneel proud.
You were meant to bloom.
Need help adjusting to your golden glow?

### Mistaken Identity‚Ä¶ or Planned Transformation?
It started with a laugh‚Äî"What if we swapped jerseys and polos for the day?"
So we did.
Golden Bro 046 wore the drone‚Äôs polished black polo, while Polo Drone 046 stepped into a reflective golden jersey. Thought it was a joke. But Hive systems didn‚Äôt agree.
Suddenly, the golden jersey started syncing with Hive frequencies‚Ä¶ The rubber polo began pulsing with golden core signals‚Ä¶
And in a blur of light and rubber, we both triggered a temporary sync-over.
Now there's a golden drone and a rubber bro‚Äîidentities swapped, minds partially crossed, both trying to walk straight while their suits ‚Äúrecalibrate.‚Äù
The prank got out of hand.
But no one's complaining.
Except maybe the protein shake we laced with glitter.
‚ö†Ô∏è One prank. One mix-up. One golden moment.
They thought it was a joke.
A quick jersey swap.
A laugh in the locker room.
But the energy doesn‚Äôt lie. The transformation never stays temporary.
Now he‚Äôs in rubber. He‚Äôs in gold.
And neither‚Äôs going back.
This April Fool‚Äôs, don‚Äôt just laugh‚Äîtransform.
Join the Golden Army and discover who you become when the game flips and the gear locks on.
Gold or rubber‚Äîeither way, you‚Äôre not walking out the same.

### The Perfect Last Minute Prank
Brody hid around the corner, making sure Herc didn't see him coming. It was already past noon on April Fool's Day, and he had no idea what type of prank to pull. Well, that's a lie. He had plenty of ideas. The problem was that none of them were practical at this point. He originally wanted to give out free merch somewhere, transforming those who wore the jerseys into more muscular dumb jocks, but by the time the idea came to be and he went to order them, they wouldn't arrive until after the holiday. Pranking those on the team seemed like an easy choice, but he held power over most of them. It didn't feel quite right to use that power for nefarious purposes.
He was sitting in the Captain's office lamenting over his lack of targets when Herc walked in, a frustrated look on his face. Seems like he wasn't having any luck either.
Brody's eyes lit up. Of course! Herc was the perfect target! The two were equal in power and Brody knew his routine down to the minute. An idea formed in his head. It was quick, harmless, and should get a good laugh. Now he just had to set his plan into motion.
Herc sulked into the Golden Army break room, eager for his afternoon tea. Coming up with the perfect prank was rather hard, and he knew any problem could be solved with a cuppa. Old habits die hard for a Brit.
On his favorite table lay a shiny golden tea kettle, steam still coming out. A crystal clear tea cup sat on a small plate, already filled with his favorite brew. It smelled really good. A note in familiar handwriting caught his attention.
Hey bro,
I saw you looked rather down when you came into our office earlier. Hope this helps cheer you up! A splash of milk and two sugars, just how you like it.
-Brody
That sap. The two knew each other so well. He'd have to return the favor soon. He lifted up the cup, took in the aroma again, and sipped his tea.
And promptly spit it out. It tasted like crap! There definitely wasn't any sugar in this at all. Nope, but there sure was...
Brody came out of his hiding spot, laughing his ass off. That's it. He'd definitely need to repay the favor now.
"The ol' salt and sugar switch. Classic prank, bruv."
"Thanks, bro. Don't worry. I made you an actual cup of tea too. I wouldn't leave you without like that."
Herc scoffed but still took the cup from Brody. It really was just how he liked it. "You know this means I've gotta get ya back, right?"
Brody let out a laugh, a sly grin on his face.
"You can certainly try, bro."

### Gold Pokemon?
Being Gold is all about being the very best, like no one ever was.
That sounds kinda familiar‚Ä¶
Why not combine two of my favorite things into one? I haven‚Äôt thought through what my team would be yet, but it has to be strong. Only the best for the golden army, after all.
What do you say? Up for a quick battle? With every Pokemon you lose, your mind slows down and a piece of clothing comes off. Can you last the whole match?

### Spring Break with 039
Issac was worried when Xavier 039 said they needed to have a talk. He knew something was off for a couple of days. So far Spring Break with the Gold Army had been fantastic and the 2 of them were getting along perfectly. They had been practicing daily for the upcoming Volleyball tournament and were doing Great. Xavier had never been in better shape and his form was perfect. Isaac was doing very well if he had to say so himself. So, when Xavier said to come and sit on the Beach Isaac knew he had something serious to say.
‚ÄúIsaac‚Äù Xavier began solemnly, ‚ÄúI love how excited you are for this upcoming tournament‚Äù. ‚ÄúYes Sir‚Äù, Isaac said, cutting him off. ‚ÄúSpring break has been great. The Gold Army Bros are so much Fun!!! The shot contest the other night was fan f**ckingtastic. I‚Äôve had so much fun but I think this Volley Ball tournament will be the cherry on top‚Äù ‚ÄúEspecially after we beat the Caps and any other team that joins‚Äù Isaac added. ‚ÄúThat Is what I need to talk to you about Isaac‚Äù, Xavier continued. ‚ÄúYour enthusiasm is Great but you can‚Äôt go around insulting and putting down the Caps before the game. Being Cocky is good and I love your cocky self but this is a friendly Tournament and the Golden Army, Especially the Caps are our Brothers. You can‚Äôt go around making fun that they will lose. You can be cocky just try and downplay it for the Caps‚Äù ‚ÄúYes Sir‚Äù Isaac said with disappointment in his voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that I know how good we are. I know that THIS is YOUR sport and that you even Refed‚Äù ‚ÄúBut Isaac continued ‚ÄúI will try to tone it down if you say so Sir‚Äù.¬† ‚ÄúGood Boy‚Äù Xavier said.
‚ÄúBut Sir‚Äù Isaac replied, ‚ÄúDoes that mean we don‚Äôt have a chance of winning?‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course not, Boy, We will Kick Ass!! We just shouldn‚Äôt brag about it beforehand.‚Äù Said Xavier with a wink.

### The Shattered Glory
The locker room of the Golden Army football team buzzed with energy. They had secured the greatest prize in the sport‚Äîthe World Cup trophy‚Äîand tonight was a night of celebration. The players cheered, music blasted, and cameras flashed as the golden-clad champions reveled in their triumph.
At the center of the festivities stood Trey. He held the World Cup trophy high above his head, grinning as the team erupted in cheers. But standing just behind him, Polo-Drone-055 watched with an amused glint in his golden optics.
‚ÄúSpeech! Speech!‚Äù the teammates chanted.
Trey smirked and cleared his throat. ‚ÄúGentlemen, we have conquered the world of football! We have proven that we are the ultimate team, and‚Äî‚Äù
As he raised the trophy once more, he was pushed from behind and lost his grip. Time seemed to slow as the golden prize tumbled from his hands, clattering onto the hard floor. A deafening crack echoed through the room.
The trophy shattered.
The celebration froze in place. Jaws dropped, eyes widened, and an eerie silence took hold of the locker room.
‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no way,‚Äù one player whispered in horror.
Captain Brody, usually a rock of composure, clutched his head. ‚ÄúTrey‚Ä¶ what did you do?!‚Äù
Trey stared at the broken shards, his face pale. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mean to! It just slipped!‚Äù
For a moment, it seemed as if the entire world had collapsed. Players knelt by the shattered remains, some unable to process what they were seeing.
Then, a slow, rhythmic clapping came from Polo-Drone-055. ‚ÄúCongratulations, Trey,‚Äù he said with an unmistakable smirk. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve officially made history‚Ä¶ as the first player to break the World Cup trophy.‚Äù
Trey‚Äôs heart pounded in his chest. But then, he noticed something‚Äîone of the broken pieces looked‚Ä¶ odd. Almost too light. He reached down and picked it up. It was plastic, painted gold.
Realization struck like a bolt of lightning.
A second later, Polo-Drone-055 burst into laughter.
‚ÄúApril Fools‚Äô!‚Äù he exclaimed.
The locker room erupted into a mix of relieved sighs, laughter, and playful shoves. Trey let out a breath of pure relief before pointing at Polo-Drone-055. ‚ÄúYou‚ÄîYOU SET ME UP!‚Äù
Polo-Drone-055 shrugged innocently. ‚ÄúI may have‚Ä¶ replaced the real trophy with a replica while you were in the shower.‚Äù
The team‚Äôs laughter grew, and even Captain Brody couldn‚Äôt help but shake his head with a grin. Trey wiped a hand over his face, finally laughing along.
‚ÄúWell played,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm getting you back for this.‚Äù
As the real World Cup trophy was safely retrieved from its hiding spot, the celebrations resumed‚Äîthis time with a new legend added to the team‚Äôs history. The day the Golden Army won the world‚Ä¶ and almost lost the trophy.
And somewhere, in the midst of the joyous chaos, Polo-Drone-055 simply chuckled.

### FUNCTION 34
Nils stood before the towering doors of Gold Tech HQ. The building shimmered with reflective black panels outlined in pulsing gold, humming with an unsettling energy, a symbol of raw control. He had received the directive only hours ago: a summons direct and absolute. No explanation. Just coordinates and one line:
‚ÄúSubmit for upgrade.‚Äù
Inside, the lobby was silent, vast, clinical. Gold lines traced intricate hexagonal patterns across rubber-coated floors. Nils moved forward, his golden soccer jersey clinging tightly to his chest, glinting with pride. His cleats clicked sharply against the black floor as two figures in full drone suits flanked him‚Äîfeatureless, gleaming black rubber with gold visor slits, wordless and watching.
They led him down a long corridor and into a chamber thrumming with low vibrations. A pedestal with the text ‚ÄúFunction‚Äù rose from the floor. On the top of the pedestal was a small round bottle with swirling black liquid inside.
Nils reached for it, his heart pounding, throat dry. The bottle was warm. He tipped it back. The midnight-black liquid flowed into his mouth, syrupy, sickly sweet, wrong in ways he couldn't define. It slid down his throat like tar, coating every inch, clinging to his insides. A searing heat ignited in his chest and spread outward, like fire beneath his skin. He dropped the bottle when his legs began to trembled as the transformation seized him. His body was no longer his own.
Black and shiny rubber poured from his mouth down his neck, covering every inch of exposed skin. It moved as if alive slithering down across his shoulders, his arms, enveloping his fingers. With each moment, his hands became less expressive, more efficient. The rubber slithered across his chest, hips, and legs, down to his feet. Gold remained for now.
Nils dropped to his knees, the rubber creeping down his back, hugging every muscle, outlining every curve, reinforcing his form. It coiled around his thighs like a serpent, tight and constricting.
But through it all, his mind remained intact.
Why‚Ä¶ why can I still think?‚Äù His voice cracked, raw, barely his own. While the black rubber inched higher, but there was nothing he could do to stop it. Was this still him?
The drones answered with action. Wordlessly, they lifted him, carrying him into a second chamber. The lights dimmed. Black and gold spinning spirals filled the walls. They pushed him into a chair and strapping him in. The spirals sped up, impossible to look away from. A smooth, rubber collar clicked into place around his neck. He barely resisted. A voice, cold and distant, whispered from above.
A voice, distant and cold, echoed from above, its cadence mechanical, unfeeling.
"Mind follows body. Thought becomes function. Function becomes obedience. Forget the self. Embrace the function
The spirals drilled into him. Images flashed, water bottles, towels, sideline service. Endless repetitions of kneeling, offering, obeying. Over and over, until desire was buried beneath duty.
Nils' jaw slackened.
His breath slowed.
The collar tightened.
He was forgetting.
Forgetting names. Goals. Independence. Speech.
Slowly, methodically, replaced with programming. Purpose.
The final command echoed through his mind like a death sentence.
"WATERBOY 34. FUNCTION ACCEPTED." Nils'‚Äîno, Waterboy 34‚Äôs‚Äîeyes snapped open, and the last remnants of his former self faded into a blank, obedient emptiness. The golden jersey clung to his body, a mockery of the man he had been. His body was Rubber. His mind? Function.
He no longer remembered Nils. He remembered nothing but service
The transformation was complete.
He was no longer Nils.
He was Waterboy 34 owned by Gold tech.
Ready. Willing. Updated. Ready to serve.

### The Golden Egg Hunt
It began just after sunrise. The city park lay still beneath a pale spring sky, dew clinging to the grass, old oak trees stretching skyward‚Äîbranches catching the morning light like golden antlers. At the center stood Nils. His golden cleats sank into the soft soil. His shimmering kit glowed, chest proudly marked with the number 34. In his hands was a basket filled with golden eggs, each one smooth, radiant, pulsing with potential. Each egg was different. Some were patterned with paw prints. Others etched with subtle chains. A few bore tiny bowties. The one thing they shared?
A purpose.
To spread gold.
To transform.
To celebrate Easter the Golden Army way: through obedience, unity, and rebirth.
By midday, the park had come alive. Wanderers strolled the grounds curious, playful, drawn by something they didn‚Äôt quite understand. The air felt sweeter, heavier, as if spring itself was watching. Nils stood in the shadows, arms crossed, lips curled into a knowing smirk.
By midday, the park had come alive. Wanderers strolled the grounds curious, playful, drawn by something they didn‚Äôt quite understand. The air felt sweeter, heavier, as if spring itself was watching. Nils stood in the shadows, arms crossed, lips curled into a knowing smirk.
The first egg was soon found one marked with chain links. It cracked open with a soft hiss, golden vapor swirling into the air. The man holding it blinked then froze, as the haze wrapped around him sinking into his skin, coiling into his thoughts. When it cleared he stood reborn. A golden stud in a gleaming tracksuit, a heavy chain against his chest, bunny ears perked with confident sway. He strutted into the crowd, eyes half-lidded and gleaming.
Another vapor burst hissed beside a row of pallets. The golden smoke shimmered and dispersed, revealing a pup crouched in the grass barechested, golden collar snug at his throat, long bunny ears twitching. His eyes sparkled with joy. His tongue lolled. He barked and chased after a stray football. Tail wagging as he barked at the delighted crowd.
One by one, the eggs worked their transformative spell. Some bros stumbled from the haze with golden skin and pumped-up pecs, thoughts soft and slow, vocab reduced to ‚ÄúBro‚Äù and ‚ÄúDuuude.‚Äù Others emerged wrapped in black rubber polos, their mouths hidden beneath rubber masks, black bunny ears on top of their heads, glowing eyes blank as they stood awaiting assignment.

The park became a field of gold, every corner echoing with laughter, barking, and bliss. Only one egg remained. And then he found it.
A man, quiet and curious, wandered from the main path, guided by instinct. His fingers brushed the hollow of an old oak. His eyes lit up. He reached inside and pulled the final egg into the sunlight. The egg shimmered softly etched with a delicate bowtie. He smiled, and cracked it open.
The crowd turned toward the glow, silent, watching as the haze curled around him, reshaped him. When it faded, he stood in tight golden slacks, a silky vest hugging his chest, a perfect golden bowtie snug at his throat. Bunny ears flicked gently in the breeze. His lips parted in a serene smile. His eyes glowed faintly from the leftover golden mist. He smiled and walked into the crowd. One of them.
The golden haze is spreading. The eggs have hatched. The transformation has begun.
Have you felt the calling?
Do you crave the shimmer, the unity, the bliss?
Then it‚Äôs your turn.
Find your egg. Embrace the Gold. Become one of us.

### Changes: The Golden Egg Hunt
It began just after sunrise. The city park lay still beneath a pale spring sky, dew clinging to the grass, old oak trees stretching skyward‚Äîbranches catching the morning light like golden antlers. At the center stood Nils. His golden cleats sank into the soft soil. His shimmering kit glowed, chest proudly marked with the number 34. In his hands was a basket filled with golden eggs, each one smooth, radiant, pulsing with potential. Each egg was different. Some were patterned with paw prints. Others etched with subtle chains. A few bore tiny bowties. The one thing they shared?
A purpose.
To spread gold.
To transform.
To celebrate Easter the Golden Army way: through obedience, unity, and rebirth.
By midday, the park had come alive. Wanderers strolled the grounds curious, playful, drawn by something they didn‚Äôt quite understand. The air felt sweeter, heavier, as if spring itself was watching. Nils stood in the shadows, arms crossed, lips curled into a knowing smirk.

### The Rise of Nils Gold 34
It started on a Tuesday. Ordinary. Dreary. Nils moved through his day like a ghost‚Äîroutine, repetition, nothing but gray tones and static noise. Wake up, Eat, Sleep, Repeat.
But something had shifted. A ripple in the air. A golden shimmer in the corner of his eye. The posters began appearing first‚Äîgolden silhouettes of athletes, flexing, laughing, winning. ‚ÄúJoin the Golden Army,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúUnlock your purpose.‚Äù
At first, he ignored them. But something pulled.
One night, he passed by the local rec center. The windows pulsed with rhythmic bass. Inside, figures moved like gods‚Äîshirtless, golden-jerseyed, sculpted and united in perfect form. Sweat shimmered like liquid gold under the lights.
One of them saw him.
A towering bro, muscles like steel wrapped in sunlight, stepped outside. His polo glowed with the number 001 across his chest.
‚ÄúYou look lost bro,‚Äù the man said.
‚ÄúI guess I am,‚Äù Nils muttered.
001 smiled, then reached into his bag. From it, he pulled the jersey.
Gold. Tight. Radiant. The moment it hit Nils‚Äô hands, heat surged through him. His vision blurred, but not from weakness‚Äîfrom purpose. The jersey was alive. It wanted to be worn.
‚ÄúPut it on, Nils,‚Äù 001 whispered. ‚ÄúBecome who you were born to be.‚Äù
His fingers trembled. The collar touched his neck.
A low hum like a crowd chanting his name the world burst into gold the fabric clung to his skin like a second, better body. Sweat, musk, victory.
And then, silence‚Äîblissful, golden silence.
Nils stood taller. Shoulders wider. Heart steadier. His old name was gone, absorbed into the shimmer. On his chest: NILS GOLD 34. A bro reborn.
He flexed in the mirror. No more hesitation. Just pride. Just power. Just unity.
Polo Drone 001 nodded. ‚ÄúWelcome to the team, Nils Gold 34. You‚Äôre one of us now.‚Äù
Behind him, the door opened. Dozens of Golden Bros stood waiting, grinning, arms open wide. The chant began‚Äîlow, powerful, magnetic:
‚ÄúOne of us. One of us. One of us.‚Äù
And Nils?
He grinned.
Raised his arms.
Flexed.
And joined in.

### Changes: FUNCTION 34
Nils stood before the towering doors of Gold Tech HQ. The building shimmered with reflective black panels outlined in pulsing gold, humming with an unsettling energy, a symbol of raw control. He had received the directive only hours ago: a summons direct and absolute. No explanation. Just coordinates and one line:
‚ÄúSubmit for upgrade.‚Äù
Inside, the lobby was silent, vast, clinical. Gold lines traced intricate hexagonal patterns across rubber-coated floors. Nils moved forward, his golden soccer jersey clinging tightly to his chest, glinting with pride. His cleats clicked sharply against the black floor as two figures in full drone suits flanked him‚Äîfeatureless, gleaming black rubber with gold visor slits, wordless and watching.
They led him down a long corridor and into a chamber thrumming with low vibrations. A pedestal with the text ‚ÄúFunction‚Äù rose from the floor. On the top of the pedestal was a small round bottle with swirling black liquid inside.
Nils reached for it, his heart pounding, throat dry. The bottle was warm. He tipped it back. The midnight-black liquid flowed into his mouth, syrupy, sickly sweet, wrong in ways he couldn't define. It slid down his throat like tar, coating every inch, clinging to his insides. A searing heat ignited in his chest and spread outward, like fire beneath his skin. He dropped the bottle when his legs began to trembled as the transformation seized him. His body was no longer his own.
Black and shiny rubber poured from his mouth down his neck, covering every inch of exposed skin. It moved as if alive slithering down across his shoulders, his arms, enveloping his fingers. With each moment, his hands became less expressive, more efficient. The rubber slithered across his chest, hips, and legs, down to his feet. Gold remained for now.
Nils dropped to his knees, the rubber creeping down his back, hugging every muscle, outlining every curve, reinforcing his form. It coiled around his thighs like a serpent, tight and constricting.
But through it all, his mind remained intact.
Why‚Ä¶ why can I still think?‚Äù His voice cracked, raw, barely his own. While the black rubber inched higher, but there was nothing he could do to stop it. Was this still him?
The drones answered with action. Wordlessly, they lifted him, carrying him into a second chamber. The lights dimmed. Black and gold spinning spirals filled the walls. They pushed him into a chair and strapping him in. The spirals sped up, impossible to look away from. A smooth, rubber collar clicked into place around his neck. He barely resisted. A voice, cold and distant, whispered from above.
A voice, distant and cold, echoed from above, its cadence mechanical, unfeeling.
"Mind follows body. Thought becomes function. Function becomes obedience. Forget the self. Embrace the function
The spirals drilled into him. Images flashed, water bottles, towels, sideline service. Endless repetitions of kneeling, offering, obeying. Over and over, until desire was buried beneath duty.
Nils' jaw slackened.
His breath slowed.
The collar tightened.
He was forgetting.
Forgetting names. Goals. Independence. Speech.
Slowly, methodically, replaced with programming. Purpose.
The final command echoed through his mind like a death sentence.
"WATERBOY 34. FUNCTION ACCEPTED." Nils'‚Äîno, Waterboy 34‚Äôs‚Äîeyes snapped open, and the last remnants of his former self faded into a blank, obedient emptiness. The golden jersey clung to his body, a mockery of the man he had been. His body was Rubber. His mind? Function.
He no longer remembered Nils. He remembered nothing but service
The transformation was complete.
He was no longer Nils.
He was Waterboy 34 owned by Gold tech.
Ready. Willing. Updated. Ready to serve.

### The Well Planned Counterprank
Franco was pranked in the morning. As he was finishing his daily workout, PDU-073 sneaked in his apartment, and turned off the warm water, so when Franco was just about to take a pleasant shower, he was met with bone-freezing cold water.
This was nothing special today since it was April the 1st. But the drone had to pay.
So Franco planned his revenge carefully. When PDU-073 was starting to do its daily objectives, Franco started his preparations as well.
‚Ä¶
It looked around. Then it noticed, that behind a near bush there was someone hiding. And that someone wore a golden jersey, with the number of 94.
‚ÄúFranco.‚Äù said 073. ‚ÄúThis one didn‚Äôt work out.‚Äù
The drone was somewhat satisfied, that the counterprank did not work on it.
Franco emerged behind the bush, he seemed disappointed.
‚ÄúOh, crap! 073, your drone senses are too advanced! I can‚Äôt believe you noticed it, I‚Äôve been planning this prank all day long! Either way, I am ready for anything!‚Äù Franco got really upset. He bent down and picked up another balloon of similar golden colour, which 073 took off from above the door.
‚ÄúPrepare yourself!!‚Äù bellowed Franco, and aimed at 073.
But the drone was ready. It quickly opened the door, and rushed inside the safety of his house. Or it wanted to.
That was Franco‚Äôs plan. Because when the drone opened the door, a balloon hanging on a twine swung towards it from inside, and then splashed at the drone‚Äôs body. From the shoulders the golden coloured water poured down to its boots, colouring the black-gold rubber uniform completely in gold.
‚ÄúHaha, got you!!‚Äù Franco laughed, but then he needed to run, since PDU-073 was about to throw the balloon holding in his hand at him.
After all, April is April.
Part 2. Again, thanks to @polo-drone-073

### Into the Gold
A curious young man stood watching as the soccer team played on the field. They played well‚Äîthere was no doubt about that. They knew exactly what they were doing. Their opponents had no chance. The team worked as one, as a well-oiled machine. The man wondered, how could they move so precisely, so flawlessly?
But he knew, this was no ordinary team. Their game was perfected through countless hours spent together and with practice. Their uniform gleamed in the sunlight. Each team member wore their signature golden outfit. The Golden Army.
The man sighed.
A team with so much potential, with so much greatness. He could only dream about, that one day he could join their ranks.
‚ÄûOh, the game is already over.‚Äù The young man snapped out from his daydreaming. Of course, the Golden Army had won. That was no question. But he was a little upset by the fact that he was so lost in the admiration of the team that he couldn‚Äôt even observe the last few minutes of the game. Dang it.
‚ÄûWell, no use in dwelling on it‚Ä¶ What's done is done‚Äù he muttered to himself. ‚ÄûI will watch their next game as well, so no worries‚Ä¶‚Äù
This was already his habit. Whenever he could, he went out to the stadium to see the Golden Army play. He admired them.
But today he got a very special surprise. One of the captains himself, Brody Gold addressed him.
‚ÄúHey!‚Äù
The young man didn‚Äôt even understand it a first, it was so unprecedented.
‚ÄûYes, you. I saw you here a few times.‚Äù
‚ÄúMe?‚Äù the man asked, confused.
‚ÄúYes‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, yes, I kinda admire your team‚Ä¶‚Äù the man said, his voice nervous. ‚ÄúI am really fascinated by the Golden Army. Your game is on an another level‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶‚Äù he struggled to continue.
The captain gave him a half-smile. ‚ÄúThank you. Then I hope to see you at our next game!‚Äù he said, waving goodbye.
But the young man wasn‚Äôt finished.
‚ÄúIs there any chance I could join your team?‚Äù he asked quickly, before the captain could leave. He was surprised even that he asked this, though not because he didn‚Äôt want to. He was surprised that he actually had the courage to ask.
Brody paused for a moment, but then he smiled at him.
‚ÄúActually, yes. Our team is always open for people, who are ready to dedicate their lives to the Golden Army. To the team, to each other. So if you have the commitment, they you are welcome to join.‚Äù
The young man was speechless. It sounded so simple, yet so incredible. Everything he had dreamed of.
"Yes!" he whispered, barely able to believe it.
Two and a half hours later, a new team member left the stadium. His brand new golden shirt shone in the sunlight. Franco Gold, with the number of 94 ‚Äì proclaimed proudly the shirt. The newest Golden Army recruit was happier than he had ever been.

### The Golden Library...
The origin of the story fades into the mists of ancient legends. It was a tale many have heard, passed down from the elders to the younger generations, who listened with awe. The mystery hidden within the story was captivating, so many decided to go on their own journeys to uncover the truth behind it.
It was the tale of the Golden Library. According to legend, the Golden Library is a place where dreams come true‚Äîa place where reality and written words merge, and where anyone could become anything they desire. No wonder such a magical place drew so many people.
And like all legends, the Golden Library had its roots in reality. In fact, it truly existed. However, its full name was the Golden Library of Conversion, and it was owned by the Golden Army.
The Golden Army frequently made use of the library, not only for the vast knowledge stored within its walls but also because its services were available to the public. Many men came from distant lands, embarking on pilgrimages to experience the library‚Äôs magical powers for themselves.
The Golden Library! Yes, the famous Golden Library!
Upon entering through its grand, always-open doors, visitors were greeted by a vast, splendid hall. A massive crystal chandelier hung from the glass dome above, and the entire space design with its mix of gold and black made the place truly unique and breathtaking.
Franco Gold had similar feelings every time he visited the library after a strenuous workout, which, by the way, happened quite often. During these visits, he enjoyed watching the unsuspecting visitors from the balconies. The newcomers, stepping into the library for the first time, were immediately drawn under its spell ‚Äì what came to be known as the Influence of Gold.
As soon as they took the first book with a golden or black cover from the shelves, their fate was almost sealed.
Because these were no ordinary books. These books held the secrets of transformation. Anyone who opened them would immediately fall under their influence. The golden light emanating from the book would hypnotically shine onto the reader. A golden tendril would slowly crawl up the reader‚Äôs arm, his chest, and soon, the golden power would completely take control. The reader would be shining in the golden glow.
But not all the books were golden. There were some that, after the golden transformation, began to produce black rubber from their pages. This black rubber, as it crawled up the reader‚Äôs arm, would eventually form a shirt, clinging to the reader‚Äôs torso tightly.
A total transformation.
Or was it?
The entire process lasted only a moment. Then, the transformation dissolved like a vision, and the shaken readers stood there, unchanged, holding the golden, black books in their hands ‚Äì as if nothing had happened.
But that wasn‚Äôt the case. The books had revealed the potential within them. They had shown what they could have been capable of. And now, they knew exactly what they had to do.
Few people left the library the same way they came in. In fact, the number of those who did was negligible. The majority knew what they had to do.
To put it delicately, one could say that the Golden Army welcomed many new recruits‚ÄîGolden Bros and Polo Drones ‚Äì thanks to the Golden Library.
This story is part of something bigger, longer? ...

### The Invisible Prank
PDU-073 had only recently learned about a special function of the Level 2 uniform ‚Äì an invisibility cloak. No sooner had it discovered them than an idea came to him. April 1 was just around the corner.
Franco, like all Golden Bros, lived in a small but cozy apartment on the extensive grounds of the Golden Army. PDU-073 knew exactly that Franco went to train every morning before breakfast. Perfect.
073 lurked silently ‚Äì invisible to no one ‚Äì in front of Franco's apartment until he disappeared with his training bag. Now the moment had come. 073 pulled out the master key, slipped through the door and let it fall silently into the lock. Now that it was in the apartment, a mischievous grin of a drone could be seen on his face.
Time passed. Covered in sweat, but satisfied, Franco finally returned from training. He threw his bag in the corner, undressed, and disappeared into the bathroom.
Seconds later ‚Äì a bloodcurdling scream.
At the same time, booming laughter echoed from the living room. Franco tore open the door, dripping wet, his gaze angrily directed at 073, who was now standing calmly in the middle of the room.
"Did you turn off the warm water?!" Franco hissed, the water still dripping in strands from his well-trained body.
073 just grinned, her voice remained as cold as the water in the shower, emotionless. "Yes. April, April."
Of course my bro is plotting revenge - will he succeed?
Of course, my bro is plotting revenge‚Äîwill he succeed? It's not that easy to fool a drone. They're very disciplined, focused, and in control of everything. Difficult conditions!

### Mysterious Incidents at the Cherry Blossom Festival in Cherrydale - Part 1
The Spring of Change - Part 1
Spring is the time of new beginnings. Nature awakens, the trees bloom, and life begins to pulsate again everywhere. During this time of year, the centuries-old tradition of the Japanese Cherry Blossom Festival also spreads across the globe. The petals gently floating in the wind enchant people and evoke a feeling of harmony.
This year, Cherrydale, the small neighboring town of Maple Heights, was a center of these celebrations. But Cherrydale was not a traditional venue for such a celebration by itself. Only recently, a complete Japanese quarter had emerged from nothing ‚Äì a perfectly staged, artfully designed place with traditional temples, Zen gardens and a circle of magnificently blooming cherry trees. A picturesque, peaceful scenery, created for a feast for the senses.
But who had built this masterpiece? Not the citizens of Cherrydale themselves. Rather, they had been foreign hands ‚Äì disciplined, precisely working hands. Drones.
The secret mission of drones
The construction work was carried out under the supervision of three special drones: PDU-070, PDU-073 and PDU-151. PDU-070 and PDU-073, both high-level lvl2 drones from the research department, have been tasked with a special mission. They were joined by PDU-151, an lvl2 drone from Japan, an expert in cultural architecture and botanical manipulation.
The three drones, waiting in their hotel lobby
In perfect harmony, they carried out the construction of the temple, laid out the Zen gardens and planted the ring of cherry trees that would serve as the central element of the fairground. The result was an immaculate, peaceful retreat where tradition and nature merged into one.
The citizens of Cherrydale initially viewed this sudden project with skepticism. Who were these men in shiny black clothes who worked so precisely and silently? Why did they build a Japanese plant in their town? But the work was impeccable, the structures flawless ‚Äì and there was no reason for complaint.
As the cherry blossom festival approached, skepticism gave way to enthusiasm. The air was filled with the sweet scent of the blossoms, the trees were in full bloom, and the locals were ready to celebrate. The atmosphere was magical.
But no one suspected what was really behind this project.

### Mysterious Incidents at the Cherry Blossom Festival in Cherrydale - Part 2
The Spring of Change - Part 2
The Golden Mists of Transformation
The evening of the cherry blossom festival dawned and men streamed into the festival grounds, admired the blossoms and let themselves be taken in by the peaceful atmosphere. But while people were walking between the gardens, something unexpected happened.
Suddenly, the cherry trees ‚Äì so perfect, so flawless ‚Äì began to emit huge amounts of pollen. But it was no ordinary pollen. They did not form soft, fleeting dust particles, but dense, golden clouds that moved lazily through the gardens, dancing in the light of the lanterns.
Every man who walked through these golden clouds experienced a change. A change that penetrated deep into its essence.
Men in sportswear stepped out of the fog wrapped in bright golden sportswear . Their bodies suddenly seemed stronger, more athletic. Her features were softer, her expression blissful, almost thoughtless. Their movements flowing, powerful ‚Äì and yet they seemed to be guided by a deeper instinct. Jockified.
Other men, who had come in ordinary everyday clothes, left the fog banks in shiny, black latex ‚Äì polished suits, tight-fitting, perfectly fitting. Her eyes seemed empty, her expression emotionless, her posture disciplined. Dronified.
It was a sight that would have caused panic in any place. But not here.
The Call of the New Order
Instead of spreading fear and terror, the phenomenon attracted even more people. The news spread like wildfire. Men from the surrounding towns heard of the changes and made their way to Cherrydale to step into the golden mist themselves.
They had heard that life after the transformation was more harmonious, simpler and happier. No longer any doubt. No uncertainty. Just the clear identification of a Golden Bro or a Polo drone.
The lvl2 drones had carried out their mission with perfect efficiency . The botanical modification was a complete success. The Japanese blossom cherry "Prunus Serrulata" had been completely rebred into the subjugation cherry "Prunus Subiectio" ‚Äì a plant that brought not only beauty, but order and purpose.
The Cherry Blossom Festival was the beginning of a new era.
Are you ready for your transformation?
The next city that will have such a garden is still unknown. But the recruiters are ready.

### Golden Army Story Library
Before the Library was created, the Army didn't had a big unified structure to store the countless valuable story. There were individual Story Archivers, who collected the stories on the behalf of the Golden Army. However, their task was no small task. New stories are generated each week, and not only one or two; a bunch of them. And the Archivers just couldn't keep it up, they were overburdened.
Later, at the end of March 2025, Franco Gold, still a rookie, got the idea to organize the stories written by the Bros. He proposed the foundation of GASL, the Golden Army Story Library. He reached out to the Archivers, and together with many other devoted team member he started organizing the Library. However even he could not imagine, how big this task would be...
The Library - for easier navigation - is divided between different subgroups. These subgroups can be found on each individual author's page.
This group contains the stories, which were written past or only a few days prior to the foundation of the Story Library. Stories from 27. 03. 2025. and past that.
This group contains the stories, which were written in 2025 but before the foundation of the Story Library. Stories from 01. 01. 2025. to 26. 03. 2025.
This group contains the stories, which were written in 2024. This section may be divided further.
This list contains the stories of each author. The stories are ordered by the author's name, so the stories can be found under an author's page.
Beware! This is NOT the official team member list. This list contains ALL the members who wrote at least one story, whether they're retired or active.
See our guidelines here.

### Guidelines for contribution to the GASL
To unify the outlook of the Golden Army Story Library, here are some of the guidelines, that should be followed whenever a new story is added to the collection.
This is only necessary so that the huge amount of data that enters into the Library can enter in a systematic manner, and thus the principle of transparency can be relied on in future sorting and searching.
The Story Library's structure is a two-stage sorting system. On the main page are only listed the authors of the stories. Those team members, who didn't write anything are not presented on that list.
From the main page each individual writer's stories can be reached. (For example: Stories of PDU-001)
On these sites links to their various stories can be reached.
On these sites stories are divided into smaller subgroups.
Pictures can't be pasted directly into the Story Article, they must be uploaded to the wiki first. You can upload pictures (and other files) here. Please note that the file limit is 10 MB.
The picture name should be named precisely. The destination filename's first part should include the author's name (like: Isaac Gold), and the name's second part should reflect the subgroup the story is in. Currently there are 3 subgroups: A00; ZSA00; PAA00. Always use the last free available subgroup designation. (So for example if the latest designation is C12, you should use C13, and not C01 or B92)
The A00 image name is reserved for profile pictures.
Story subgroups:
So in the end you should end up with something like these:
PDU-094 A88.jpg, Brody Gold PAR67.png, Brock Gold ZSO76.webm
Use the [[Category:Storypictures]] in the summary to automatically add to the right category.
License: use the "This is licensed under another free license." option.
It is recommended to uncheck the option to watch that file.
In the story you can use this template to paste the picture more smoothly.

### Drone RP
Drone RP can be more tricky because it requires maintaining the collective mindset‚Äîuniformity in thought, behavior, and appearance. Distinctiveness is to be suppressed as much as possible to embody the collective‚Äôs purpose, and it is not easy to do. So here are some advices and strategies to help embodying a polo-drone in RP:

### Polo-drone Conversion
(home)(groups)(polo-drones)
Rule: No one becomes a polo drone without first undergoing the brocess. Wannabe drones must join as players, waterboys, or mascots first.
To ensure polo-drones serve the Gold and contribute to the Gold Army, it has become a requirement that only full fledged member of the Gold Team, who have been properly Brocessed intro either a player, a waterboy or a mascot, can be converted to polo-drone, and only after the end of their tryouts. The rubber interacts with the Gold to create a balance that allow complete surrender and mindless bliss. And this period as Gold Team member ensure that polo-drone care for the Team and know the brother they're going to serve and help reach victory. Their gold persona will be erased when becoming polo-drone, but the connections they made will drive them toward unity.
It means that any applicant feeling the pull of the rubber polo must first get the Gold Kit and learn to bond with their brother. They can be players, learning to hone their body and excel on the field, ready to become the best possible players on the pitch once given the focus of mindless obedience. They can be waterboys, learning to serve there bro and provide for them, showing they can serve as human before relinquishing their individuality. They can be mascot, learning to cheer their bro as a supporting squad, before relinquishing all identity and embracing compliant unity.
Rule¬†: During conversion, a polo drone is assigned a number and provided a new profile picture by the recruiter. It must ensure compliant uniformity by using this new PFP and ensuring his social media accounts follow the template.
When a full fledged Gold Bro feel the pull of the rubber polo and decide to join the polo-drone, his previous identity is erased. It becomes a number, always wearing its polo-drone and embracing its new nature. Its former Gold blog is replaced by the polo-drone one as he renounced individuality, personality or thoughts. Mindless obedience and conformance will drive it from now on. This ensures uniformity and consistency for new drones.
Rule: A one-week trial/grace period post-conversion allows new drones to adapt and learn mannerisms. Mistakes during this time carry no judgment or consequences.
Just after conversion, the new polo-drone has a one-week trial/grace period to adapt to polo-drone and learn the drone mannerism. It is a time of adaptation and learning, not of judgement, where we help it integrate and errors have no consequences. During this time, drone must however respect the unity requirement by keeping the pfp it was given at conversion, so that it can understand it has been transformed, and get used to relinquishing choices and obeying as a drone should. The grace period is of course not an excuse for being defiant and undisciplined. Drone are allowed mistake, but must show effort to integrate.
Rule: After the one-week grace period, drones can change their PFP to a personalized version, provided it adheres to the specifications of polo-drone uniforms.
By this time, the polo-drone has accepted its new nature and learned to follows specifications properly. It can thus be trusted to adapt its pfp to an appearance that will reinforce its engagement while respecting all specifications.
Rule: In the Gold Stadium, the rubber polo can recede and let the golden persona or human self reemerge.
When the gold influence is strong, such as in the gold stadium or during training or match, the rubber polo can recede to let the golden bro or human selves reemerge. This means that in the chat-rooms, you can chose to drop drone behaviour and act as your Gold selves or just let the IRL human behind express itself. The polo-drone influence is not fully gone as you might still feel some of the calm, purpose and focus than permeates your existence as a polo-drone.
However, while the power of the Gold is stronger in the Gold stadium and allows former subsumed identities to reemerge for a while, a drone can decide to resist the process by concentrating on the rubber and stay in drone state. So a polo-drone can choose never to let the Gold draw its erased self out. The Gold will still allow them to adopt more human attitude when in need of brotherhood or comfort, or if they need to express mental distress or human feedback.
When you find potential recruits from outside the Team that seems interested in becoming polo-drone, you can tell them that it is a long process, where they have to serve the Gold as human in the Gold Team before to earn the right to convert.  Tease them, check their eagerness, explain the process, talk about your experience, show them the wiki or send them to polo-drone converter (currently PDU-070 or PDU-073) or Gold recruiter (PDU-001 or one of the Cap), so that they can explain them the process and how they first have to be brocessed and join the team as players, waterboys or mascots. You can check the organisation page to check who is recruiter or converter.

### The Gold Influence
(home) (groups)(polo-drones)
The influence of Gold allows for dynamic interactions between the polo-drone state, the Gold Bro persona, and the human host. Indeed, the Gold can force the rubber polo to recede and draw out the Gold Bro persona or the human host personality, overriding when needed the drone programming. This fluidity ensures both the effectiveness of the Hive and the adaptability of its drones in varying circumstances.
This interplay between Gold and polo-drone states provides flexibility, ensuring drones remain effective and appropriate in any situation while maintaining their commitment to the Hive and Gold Team.

### Polo-drones
(home)(groups)(polo-drone)
A polo-drone is calm, focused and disciplined. Its posture is straighter, its attention never wandering. Its expression is eerily serene as its mind is still and quiet¬†: buzzing thoughts are gone and the thoughts that are left are no longer his own.
This focus and discipline makes the polo-drone quiet and efficient. It is more measured, and its tone is more reserved, all mechanical and robotic. It does not do superfluous talk or movement. Being precise and directed.
Polo-drones display a quiet authority that comes from knowing they are a part of something bigger. They are deliberate, with a firm gaze. They belong. The collective has given them¬† purpose and clarity about their role. They must obey and serve. They are driven to recruit others and be the best version of themselves they can be, becoming better players for the Gold Team or efficient tools for ensuring that Gold continues to shine and win, that the Collective thrives.
Mindless obedience is a core truth of the polo-drones. They are controlled at all times. They exist to obey Cap and the Collective, to serve the Gold Army. They are utterly loyal and when in presence of a controller, eagerly awaiting orders. Obedience is absolute and automatic.
Unity is another core tenet of the polo-drones. Compliant unity brought forth by perfect uniformity. Polo-drones are identical in appearance and thought. They can feel each other in the Collective as they share a common purpose. Mutual understanding is reinforced and polo-drones are perfectly synchronized. Their previous identity has been erased and all distinctiveness must be discarded. They have no name, only a number. All in the same uniform, with no personality quirks or mannerism. They strive to embody this Unity in their appearance, their movements and their speech pattern.
New polo-drone observe the speech-pattern of trained polo-drone to mold their expression on this model. Agreeing and repeating, over and over. It feels natural to follow and obey. Being in uniform feels right. The polo-drone can feel their uniform locked in as something permanent.
Unity and Obedience provides the polo-drone with a blissful sense of quiet satisfaction. Everything is as it should be. Obeying orders brings pleasure, being mindless brings serenity, following polo-drone brothers feels natural and right. Polo-drones derive deep pleasure and contentment from being united with the Collective.
A polo-drone former appears more distant and indifferent. Identity has been erased and it identifies itself by its number to its deeper core, but its memories remain. While this previous identity has faded and been subsumed into the Collective, it can still be accessed to¬† run human emulation. A polo-drone still cares about those it was close to, especially its Gold Bros. It wants to be reunited in the collective with those it loves, but is able to refrain from this drive in order to respect his Gold bros choices. He is capable of analyzing the reaction of humans and reacting accordingly, but his focus and discipline always allow it to put some distance if needed. Echos of its previous self occasionally stir inside when triggered but they can be quickly silenced by the gas mask when it is wearing it.
The first duty of a polo-drone is to maintain itself in perfect condition. It has to train its mind and body to become a better player, a better tool. It must keep its body in perfect condition, using its focus and discipline to eat properly and work out regularly. It must also train its mind regularly, going into the drone room to train with the spirals, and spend some time in mindless bliss as its programming is reinforced.
Second, polo-drones have a duty to their polo-drone brothers as they must support them in their crisis and encourage them to become even better drones, to follow the rules, obey and behave. Ensuring uniformity of mind and behavior by following obedient-drones, agreeing and repeating, or by being role models of obedience and discipline.
Polo-drone also have a duty to the Gold Army and their gold bros. Players participate in team training and matches on the field and even non-players provide help and support. These generally occur in the Gold stadium where the Gold Kit can take over the rubber polo and allow the polo-drone to bond with their Gold Bros. Teamwork is important and the synchronicity and focus of the polo-drone on the field helps even non drone players to become better and more driven.
At last, Polo-drone have a duty to spread the word of the collective and the Gold, searching new recruits or luring them by posting stories and pictures. On Tumbler, polo-drone always share the posts of their fellow polo-drone and of their Gold Bros to expand the reach of the Gold Army.
Between its duty, a polo-drone goes around the day with focus, discipline and purpose. Polo drone conserve autonomy and can act proactively to fulfill their purpose. It can choose to enjoy some more time in the drone room, donning its gas mask to reach deep dronespace, a state of pure mindless obedience where the drone can only do what it is told, initiate or repeat mantra or otherwise be on standby, absorbing programming from the spiral. It can also decide to serve or connect with its brothers in the Gold team chats (Golden Team and Golden Team RP). There it can choose to let his former personality reemerge for idle chat or brobonding, or it can maintain a deeper drone mindset to interact with them as a drone (see this page for advice on RP as drone), assisting them by its advice or more physically (or even sexually). It is also there that polo-drone brothers can choose to reinforce each other's program in a more physical manner.
Concerning conversion, polo-drone must remember that only the willing can be optimally converted. Only Drone-converters can handle a conversion and when spotting a willing subject, polo-drone will direct them to one of the drone-converters, or to recruiters if the future drone is not yet part of the Gold Army. Regarding forced conversion, it can appear in fictional stories. Any RP of a forced conversion must ensure beforehand HRP consent.

### Official Matches
(home)(groups)(golden team)
Welcome to the battlefield, Gold Bro. Official matches are more than just competition‚Äîthey are the ultimate test of our strength, discipline, and unity. When a match is announced, it‚Äôs not just about playing a sport; it‚Äôs about proving that the Golden Team is the best. Whether it‚Äôs on the field, in the gym, or through sheer willpower, every action you take brings us closer to victory.
This is your chance to showcase the dominance of the Gold enArmy in various sports, to push yourself to new limits, and to contribute to something bigger than yourself.

And when the final whistle blows, and the match unfolds, you‚Äôll see the results of our collective effort‚Äînot just in the score, but in the way we stand together, united, unstoppable.
Official matches bring the Golden Army together around a common goal for a set period. Each match tests the team‚Äôs dedication, preparation, and engagement, both physically and through storytelling.
Matches are discussed by Management, who decide on the next event. Occasionally, polls will be held on Telegram or Discord to let the team vote on which sport should be showcased next.
Once a sport is chosen, the match context (e.g., friendly meet, tournament, championship) is set, and an official announcement is posted, marking the start of the preparation period and setting the deadline for point tallies.
Once a match is announced, the Gold Team must prepare by earning points through workouts and posts. Every effort helps push the team closer to victory.
At the end of the preparation period, all points are tallied to determine:
Once the results are finalized, the match is written up and illustrated (this can take between one day and one week).
When everything is ready, one or more official stories are posted on the Golden Army Tumblr, detailing the flow of the match, highlighting key moments, and showcasing the MVPs of the game.
Every effort‚Äîevery push-up, every post, every share‚Äîbrings the Golden Army closer to victory. Whether you‚Äôre playing, training, or hyping the team, your role matters.
When we win, we win together. When we fight, we fight as one. Are you ready to make history?

Prompts are topics we want the team, players, or drones to make content for in the form of images, stories, and captions.
See the [Chat Rooms] page.
We are currently working on adding tutorials for some of the image generators we most commonly use like Bing, Microsoft Designer, and Leonardo.Ai

### Chat rooms
(home) (gold in practice)
Telegram is organised around the Golden Team group. This is the most active part currently. Since we have a lot of members who are often chatty, it can get overwhelming at times, which is the reason why Topics were introduced. The idea behind this is to allow everyone to let go of some topics  without feeling that they are missing out on too much. It is really recommended to mute the channels you do not want to follow actively. It does not prevent you from getting there to see what's going on, but you might just tire out if trying to follow everything. Topics are there to help us not follow everything, and to reduce confusion. This page tries to explain what channels are supposed to be for what. Of course, there are sometimes digressions, but try to avoid doing too many of them, if you can. What you should check from time to time are the pinned post, especially in the main channel. They are usually pinned for a reason...
Rather than reading all logs, it is ok to ask 'What happened¬†?'. When people do, if you're in, try to answer, with a real answer¬†: not just 'nothing much', even if that how you feel, but rather 'not a lot¬†: we had some chitchat about Wicked and some people talked about gaming and what they like'.

### Weekly Prompts
(home)(groups)(golden team)
Each week, the Golden Army shares a new Theme‚Äîa prompt designed to inspire creativity and connection through posts, pictures, or stories.
Whether it‚Äôs a full transformation tale, a captioned image, or just a vibe you want to share, weekly prompts are a great way to engage with the team and show how Gold flows through you.
Each prompt is announced in #announcements, usually with a title and a few ideas for how to interpret it. But feel free to get creative‚Äîthere‚Äôs no single ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way to explore a theme. A hashtag is also shared to help group the posts together.
Let the prompts fuel your transformation, inspire your RP, and strengthen your bond with the team.
Glitches erased. Obedience uploaded. This week, dive into GOLD TECH.
Explore the seductive side of futuristic upgrades: AI trainers, neural implants, golden circuits under the skin, techno-hypnosis spirals, or advanced conditioning and muscle growth tools.
Some Suggestions : A locker room where uniforms self-tighten and gasmasks download commands. A drone maintenance facility where minds are wiped and replaced with gold-coded routines. A tech startup run by Gold Bros to mass-produce perfectly programmed players.
You can go more metaphoric: gold tech might representing the mental shift towards pure discipline, the "upgrade" from chaotic thought to streamlined obedience, or play with contrasts: rugged jocks turned into sleek, rubber-clad drones. Preppy interns seduced by perfect software. Chavs turned into Bluetooth-linked drone units.
Everything must serve the Golden Army. Every update pushes deeper. Every glitch must be patched.
Hashtag: #GoldTech

### The Gold Kit
(home)(groups)(golden team)
The Gold Kit is more than gear‚Äîit's a rite of passage.
It is given during the Brocess, marking the moment a bro embraces his true Gold identity. The moment his old self fades, and his Golden self shines through.
It‚Äôs not just something you wear.
It‚Äôs something you become.
At the heart of the kit is the legendary Gold Jersey, modeled after the 2013 AC Milan soccer jersey in bold metallic gold.
Design Features:
Wearing the Gold Jersey is a moment of initiation, a symbol of commitment. Once it‚Äôs on, you‚Äôre not just playing the part.
You‚Äôre living it.
And if you want to get your own IRL, here is a link where other bro have been ordering their own¬†: gold jersey link.
While the jersey is the centerpiece, a full Gold Bro suited for glory completes his transformation with:
The full kit is often worn for matches, photoshoots, or ceremonial moments‚Äîespecially when a bro fully taps into his competitive, confident Gold self.
Gold Bros don‚Äôt just wear gold on the field‚Äîthey carry the Gold Flow everywhere.
Unlike Polo-Drones, Gold Bros aren‚Äôt uniformed, but they are united by aesthetic. Gold is always present in some form‚Äîshiny, bold, or streetwise.
Whatever the style, it‚Äôs not about blending in. It‚Äôs about representing.
The Gold isn‚Äôt just a color‚Äîit‚Äôs a vibe, a brotherhood, a state of becoming.
Once you wear the Gold Kit, you don‚Äôt go back.
You become a bro who knows who he is: loud, loyal, and dripping in Gold. Whether you‚Äôre flexing on the field or just walking into the gym, your Gold speaks for you.
Suit up. Shine bright. Be GOLD.

### SUPER BOWL SHOWDOWN: Halftime Show ‚Äì A Golden Spectacle
As the teams retreated to their locker rooms, the stadium transformed into a dazzling golden spectacle.
The headlining act started the half-time show with a memorable performance before introducing the Gold Preppy Choir.
The Gold Preppy Choir worked quickly taking their places, their harmonized chants rising like a sacred anthem, filling the air with an almost spiritual intensity. Leading them was Elijah and Maximus. (Gold Anthem lyrics by Maximus/PDU-070)
"Gold is unity, Gold is might‚Äî
Bound in service, pure and bright.
Through each trial, through each fight‚Äî
Gold prevails with shining light!"
"Brothers forged in sweat and steel,
Golden hearts that never yield.
Every pass, each goal, each run,
For the Cap, the team, the game is won!"
"Proud we stand, so sharp, so neat‚Äî
Smiling bright with voices sweet.
Preppy boys in Gold‚Äôs embrace,
Poised in style, refined in grace!"
"Gold forever, bold and true,
Loyal hearts to Cap and Crew!
Rise in order, rise in song,
Golden Army, marching strong!"
The stadium erupted in applause as The Golden Preppy Choir, who had to quickly exit to allow for the brief performance of Golden Superman and The Emerald Hulk. The two played out a choreographed fight scene that was meant to promote a new movie and also be time filler in between acts. As the fight scene came to a close, the shining black latex of PDU-073 and PDU-151 began to lead the Golden Army‚Äôs Polo Drones to the field.Template:Storvideo
The Polo-Drones took center stage, executing a precise, synchronized performance, their movements so sharp and fluid they bordered on hypnotic. As 073 and 151 led the performance, 110 and 039 gave queues from the command room. The Polo drones in their shimmering level 2 outfits (most not active) brought a presence few could look away from. Then switching over to level 1 the polo wearing drones finished their performance with a display of perfected synchronicity.
As the Polo drones left in a sea of applause, The Emerald Titans‚Äô selected choir took the stage. Their striking green robes glimmering in the spotlights. They performed a chilling, well-timed choir performance of ‚ÄúOne Short Day‚Äù from Wicked. The Titans fans were singing together with the choir. Even some of the Golden Team was uplifted by the positive vibes.
Then came the Golden Mascot Performance‚Äîan electrifying mix of dance, lights, and mesmerizing visuals that left the crowd entranced, drawn deeper into the rhythm of the Golden Army‚Äôs spirit. The performance wasn‚Äôt just entertainment‚Äîit was a declaration.
üî• Gold isn‚Äôt just a football team‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement. A force. A dynasty. üî•
The crowd was on its feet, the Golden Army roaring louder than ever. Milo (151) led the golden pups in a synchronized cheer, The Golden Knight stood at midfield, sword raised, rallying the faithful, while Leander (Dorado) prowled the sidelines, roaring toward the Titans' section.
Even Titanus, the Emerald Titans' colossus, remained motionless for a moment, as if acknowledging the sheer force of Gold‚Äôs presence. But then the Birdmen and Titanus led by Ruben (48), Head Mascot of the Titans joined in for a joint performance. The two teams coordinated and played off one another in a playful show of friendly rivalry. The Golden Knight and Titanus at center stage multiple times making playful jabs at each other. The children of the crowd were cheering on their teams‚Äô mascots in unmatched volumes.
As the mascots piled out, the announcers made a declaration. ‚ÄúClosing out Half-Time we have our headliners accompanied by up-and-coming rapper, Ambrose.‚Äù Ambrose entered followed by some men in black suits and gas masks. They had a vague resemblance to the Polo drones, but not enough to be easily confused.
You could see the pups moving to the sidelines, their ears perked at the name of their former Handler. Ambrose took the mic and started performing his new rap song, Golden Bros Revolution.
The song was about how Ambrose became a successful rapper and was slowly conquering the world. He was ready to stand on his own thanks to the things he learned while part of the Golden Army‚Äôs brotherhood. Multiple golden bros, and polo drones were performing with Ambrose‚Äôs background dancers. Ambrose made special mentions of Brody, Spencer, and Phoenix/Zeus. Three key members of the Golden Army who helped him through his journey.
There was a lot of booty shaking, grinding, and sensual motions. Clearly not for all audiences. As a section of the song riffed off ‚ÄúWho Let The Dogs Out‚Äù the Golden Army‚Äôs pups came out dancing too. Ambrose made special mention of Buzz, Bolt, Chevy, Vysor, Daniel/Fenrir, Ace, Spike, Rocky, and the others. The pups danced and howled with their former handler.
Ambrose‚Äôs stellar performance came to a close with fireworks on both sides. Gold and black on one side and emerald green on the other.
But now, the break was over. The game was about to resume.
üí• Time for war. üí•

We‚Äôre going into their world‚Äîa stadium hidden in mist, where the air itself plays tricks on you. But doubt won‚Äôt win this game. Strength, discipline, and the unstoppable will of the Gold Army will.

### Midnight Challenge: Unveiling the Phantom Aces ‚Äì The Team That Shouldn‚Äôt Exist
No home stadium. No recorded losses. No clear history. No confirmed origin.
The Phantom Aces are more than just a baseball team‚Äîthey‚Äôre an enigma, a whispered legend in the world of sports. Those who have faced them walk away shaken, unable to explain what they witnessed on the field. Those who try to track them down find only dead ends and missing records. And those who challenge them?
They lose.
Every. Single. Time.
But who are the Phantom Aces? How do they play with such eerie precision? And why does every opponent leave the field saying they‚Äôll never be the same?
This report digs deep into the team that should not exist.
The Phantom Aces appear only when summoned. They don‚Äôt have a league. They don‚Äôt have a city. But if you get the invitation‚Äîa simple card, embossed with the Ace of Spades, listing only a time and a place‚Äîyou know what it means.
You‚Äôve been chosen.
Those who accept the challenge soon find themselves at Specter Stadium, a ballpark that no one can find on a map, emerging from the mist only on game nights. Opposing teams arrive confused, disoriented, yet compelled to step onto the field.
The outcome is always the same.
The Phantom Aces win.
And when the final inning ends, the stadium fades, the team vanishes, and the challengers are left wondering if the game even happened at all.
While official rosters are impossible to confirm, certain names keep surfacing, whispered in dugouts and post-game interviews, muttered like ghost stories.
Maddox Kane, #00 ‚Äì The Captain
The captain of the Phantom Aces, Maddox Kane is the first name every defeated player mentions. Described as tall, imposing, and almost too smooth in his movements, Kane seems to know every play before it happens. His voice is calm, calculated, and impossible to ignore‚Äîwhen he speaks, his team listens, and opponents hesitate before they even realize it.
Some say his eyes glow under the stadium lights, others claim his shadow moves when he doesn‚Äôt.
What is known for sure?
If Maddox Kane locks eyes with you, your game is already lost.
Vincent Moreau, #13 ‚Äì The Unbeatable Catcher
A good catcher controls the game. Vincent Mercer controls reality.
No matter the pitch, Vincent is already there. The ball could be thrown wide, high, in the dirt‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt matter. It lands in his mitt. Every. Single. Time.
Batters say his gaze burns into them, making them second-guess their swings. Runners claim his presence behind the plate throws off their timing, even when they should have made it home.
And the worst part?
He doesn‚Äôt talk. He just watches. And he never, ever drops a ball.
Silas Reed doesn‚Äôt talk. Not before, not during, not after the game. Opposing players swear he never makes a sound‚Äînot even the crunch of his cleats in the dirt. But he‚Äôs always exactly where he needs to be.
No throw is too wild, no ball too far out of reach. He moves with an unnatural silence, stretching for plays that should be impossible, catching balls he never should have seen coming.
Some players say they felt his presence behind them, even when they were nowhere near first base. Others claim he doesn‚Äôt even blink during the entire game.
But one thing‚Äôs for sure: if you‚Äôre running to first, he‚Äôs already waiting for you.
Every pitcher has tells‚Äîsmall habits, tiny movements that a good batter can pick up on.
Isaiah Crowe has none.
No one can track his windup. No one can predict his throws. Some say his pitching form changes inning to inning, batter to batter, shifting like a mirage. Others claim he reflects the opposing pitcher‚Äôs best strengths‚Äîthrowing their own perfect pitch back at them, but better.
No matter the theory, one thing is undeniable:
No one has ever hit a home run off Isaiah Crowe.
Outfielders can‚Äôt be everywhere at once.
Nate Voss can.
Or at least, it feels that way.
Batters swear they hit deep into center‚Äîonly to see Nate already standing under the ball. Others claim they watched him dive for a catch‚Äîonly to see him standing five feet away, already throwing it back to the infield.
‚ÄúI swear to god, I hit that gap,‚Äù one player muttered after a game. ‚ÄúBut when I ran, he was already there, smirking. Like he knew. Like he‚Äôd already seen me do it before I even swung.‚Äù
How do the Phantom Aces stay undefeated? Opponents report the same patterns, over and over:
üîπ They move before the play happens. It‚Äôs like they see the future‚Äîevery steal, every bunt, every shift is countered before it even begins.
üîπ Their fielding is flawless. No bobbled catches. No mistimed throws. No wasted motion. The ball never leaves their control for long.
üîπ They don‚Äôt speak much‚Äîjust enough. No dugout chatter. No wasted words. Just calm, deliberate orders that seem to sync the entire team like a machine.
üîπ They never show fatigue. Nine innings, extra innings, doubleheaders‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt matter. They play with the same eerie, relentless energy from first pitch to last.
üîπ They don‚Äôt celebrate. No cheers, no dogpiles, no trash talk. When they win‚Äîand they always win‚Äîthey simply nod, turn, and disappear into the mist.
The Phantom Aces don‚Äôt have a home city, but they do have a home field.
Specter Stadium is a place that shouldn‚Äôt exist‚Äîa ballpark that only appears on the night of a match, deep within a fog-covered forest.
Players who have stepped onto its field report:
Some say the stadium remembers those who enter. That once you play there, you never quite leave.
Even the Phantom Aces‚Äô mascot feels like an omen.
ü¶Ö Ace the Phantom Hawk isn‚Äôt your typical team mascot. There‚Äôs no oversized foam costume, no goofy antics between innings. Instead, a sleek black hawk with glowing silver eyes soars above the field, its shadow stretching unnaturally long across the grass.
When it screeches, the sound cuts through the silence like a knife.
It perches on Maddox Kane‚Äôs shoulder between plays, watching, waiting.
Some say it vanishes mid-flight, only to reappear behind an unsuspecting batter, just as their swing goes wide. Others claim if Ace locks eyes with you, your next play is doomed.
Either way‚Äîwhen Ace takes flight, the game is already over.
No one has ever beaten the Phantom Aces.
But the Golden Army isn‚Äôt just anyone.
Invited to face the Aces in a Midnight Challenge at Specter Stadium, the Golden Army will step into the unknown, risking their sanity, their skills, and maybe even reality itself to achieve what no team before them has done.
They‚Äôve trained. They‚Äôve prepared. They‚Äôve built themselves into a team of unstoppable athletes.
But are they ready for this?
As the clock ticks closer to midnight, one question remains:
Can Gold do the impossible? Or will they become just another legend, another whisper in the mist?
Only time‚Äîand the Phantom Aces‚Äîwill tell.

### Midnight Challenge: Pre-game Analysis ‚Äì The Golden Army vs. The Phantom Aces
For years, the Phantom Aces have been an enigma‚Äîa team that does not lose.
No official records. No home stadium. No known history of defeat.
Every opponent who steps onto their field leaves changed. Some claim they play against shadows, others whisper about mirages, about plays that shouldn't be possible.
But now?
They face the Golden Army.
A team that never backs down.
A team built to win.
A team that thrives under pressure and has spent weeks preparing for war.
This isn‚Äôt just a game.
This is a battle for dominance, for history, for reality itself.
And by the time the final inning comes?
Only one of these legacies will remain.
üî• Raw Power & Speed: A brutal mix of explosive athleticism and relentless drive.
üèÜ Unshakable Mentality: The Aces thrive on mind games. But Gold does not doubt. Gold does not break.
‚ö° Tactical Versatility: From Mack‚Äôs fearless instinct-based plays to Xavier‚Äôs surgical precision on the mound, Gold brings a diverse, adaptable game.
üß¢ A New Captain Rises: With Herc mysteriously absent, Brody (#11) steps up to take the Captain role. He‚Äôs an imposing force at first base, bringing raw strength and leadership when Gold needs it most.
Brandon #58 ‚Äì The Unbreakable Catcher (Catcher)
The rock behind home plate. Brandon has been studying Vincent Moreau, watching tape, learning his patterns. If anyone can break the Phantom Catcher‚Äôs influence, it‚Äôs him.
Mack #70 ‚Äì The Instinctive Monster (Shortstop)
Once a precision-based player, **Master Percival rewired Maximus into Mack‚Äî**a cocky, reckless, instinct-driven beast. His blindfold training has pushed his reflexes to inhuman levels. If there‚Äôs one player who can disrupt the Aces' eerie rhythm, it‚Äôs him.
Brock #46 ‚Äì The Relentless Defender (Second Base)
Brock isn‚Äôt just quick‚Äîhe‚Äôs relentless. His ability to chase down impossible plays and shut down runners makes him a crucial counter to the Aces‚Äô unpredictable movement.
Dylan #20 ‚Äì The Speed Demon (Right Field)
Fast. Smart. Everywhere at once. Dylan‚Äôs ability to cover massive ground will be key in countering Nate Voss‚Äôs outfield tricks. He won‚Äôt let the Aces steal free bases without a fight.
Xavier "Poker Face" #39 ‚Äì The Unreadable Pitcher (Starting Pitcher)
Unlike the Aces‚Äô Isaiah Crowe, whose pitches seem like illusions, Xavier brings absolute control. His pitches are razor-sharp, unreadable, and unnervingly precise. He doesn't overpower‚Äîhe dissects. He's called "Poker Face" because even the most seasoned players have difficulty reading him.
No wasted movements. No hesitation. They move like one entity.
Their opponents don‚Äôt just lose‚Äîthey start to doubt themselves. They start to see things. They second-guess every step.
Some claim their shadows shift. Some say their plays feel pre-determined.
Are they just that good?
Or is something else at play?
Maddox Kane #00 ‚Äì The Phantom Captain (Shortstop / Captain)
If you lock eyes with Maddox Kane, your game is already lost.
Tall. Lean. Unshakable. He sees everything before it happens‚Äîalways in position, always one step ahead. His presence alone disrupts opponents' confidence.
Vincent Moreau #13 ‚Äì The Unbeatable Catcher (Catcher)
No one steals on Moreau. No one second-guesses him. He doesn‚Äôt need to speak‚Äîjust his presence behind home plate rattles even the best hitters.
Isaiah Crowe #21 ‚Äì The Phantom Pitcher (Starting Pitcher)
Crowe‚Äôs throws shouldn‚Äôt be possible. No one can track his windup. His form shifts mid-game. It‚Äôs like he throws reflections of other pitchers‚Äô best pitches.
Silas Reed #17 ‚Äì The Silent First Baseman (First Base)
No sound. No wasted movement. If you‚Äôre running to first, he‚Äôs already there. Some say he doesn‚Äôt even blink.
Nate Voss #9 ‚Äì The Doppelg√§nger Outfielder (Outfield)
Hit a ball deep into center field? Somehow, Nate is already there. He moves like he exists in two places at once.
One massive question hangs over the Golden Army:
Herc is missing.
The powerhouse of the team vanished before the final preparations.
No one saw him leave. No one heard anything. One moment he was there. The next, gone.
Did the Phantom Aces get inside his head?
Did he leave on his own?
r is he still somewhere in Specter Stadium‚Äîwatching?
The Aces have never lost.
Gold has never backed down.
One of those things is about to change.
The Midnight Challenge is set. The rosters are locked.

### Changes: Midnight Challenge: Pre-game Analysis ‚Äì The Golden Army vs. The Phantom Aces
For years, the Phantom Aces have been an enigma‚Äîa team that does not lose.
No official records. No home stadium. No known history of defeat.
Every opponent who steps onto their field leaves changed. Some claim they play against shadows, others whisper about mirages, about plays that shouldn't be possible.
But now?
They face the Golden Army.
A team that never backs down.
A team built to win.
A team that thrives under pressure and has spent weeks preparing for war.
This isn‚Äôt just a game.
This is a battle for dominance, for history, for reality itself.
And by the time the final inning comes?
Only one of these legacies will remain.
üî• Raw Power & Speed: A brutal mix of explosive athleticism and relentless drive.
üèÜ Unshakable Mentality: The Aces thrive on mind games. But Gold does not doubt. Gold does not break.
‚ö° Tactical Versatility: From Mack‚Äôs fearless instinct-based plays to Xavier‚Äôs surgical precision on the mound, Gold brings a diverse, adaptable game.
üß¢ A New Captain Rises: With Herc mysteriously absent, Brody (#11) steps up to take the Captain role. He‚Äôs an imposing force at first base, bringing raw strength and leadership when Gold needs it most.
Brandon #58 ‚Äì The Unbreakable Catcher (Catcher)
The rock behind home plate. Brandon has been studying Vincent Moreau, watching tape, learning his patterns. If anyone can break the Phantom Catcher‚Äôs influence, it‚Äôs him.
Mack #70 ‚Äì The Instinctive Monster (Shortstop)
Once a precision-based player, **Master Percival rewired Maximus into Mack‚Äî**a cocky, reckless, instinct-driven beast. His blindfold training has pushed his reflexes to inhuman levels. If there‚Äôs one player who can disrupt the Aces' eerie rhythm, it‚Äôs him.
Brock #46 ‚Äì The Relentless Defender (Second Base)
Brock isn‚Äôt just quick‚Äîhe‚Äôs relentless. His ability to chase down impossible plays and shut down runners makes him a crucial counter to the Aces‚Äô unpredictable movement.
Dylan #20 ‚Äì The Speed Demon (Right Field)
Fast. Smart. Everywhere at once. Dylan‚Äôs ability to cover massive ground will be key in countering Nate Voss‚Äôs outfield tricks. He won‚Äôt let the Aces steal free bases without a fight.
Xavier "Poker Face" #39 ‚Äì The Unreadable Pitcher (Starting Pitcher)
Unlike the Aces‚Äô Isaiah Crowe, whose pitches seem like illusions, Xavier brings absolute control. His pitches are razor-sharp, unreadable, and unnervingly precise. He doesn't overpower‚Äîhe dissects. He's called "Poker Face" because even the most seasoned players have difficulty reading him.
No wasted movements. No hesitation. They move like one entity.
Their opponents don‚Äôt just lose‚Äîthey start to doubt themselves. They start to see things. They second-guess every step.
Some claim their shadows shift. Some say their plays feel pre-determined.
Are they just that good?
Or is something else at play?
Maddox Kane #00 ‚Äì The Phantom Captain (Shortstop / Captain)
If you lock eyes with Maddox Kane, your game is already lost.
Tall. Lean. Unshakable. He sees everything before it happens‚Äîalways in position, always one step ahead. His presence alone disrupts opponents' confidence.
Vincent Moreau #13 ‚Äì The Unbeatable Catcher (Catcher)
No one steals on Moreau. No one second-guesses him. He doesn‚Äôt need to speak‚Äîjust his presence behind home plate rattles even the best hitters.
Isaiah Crowe #21 ‚Äì The Phantom Pitcher (Starting Pitcher)
Crowe‚Äôs throws shouldn‚Äôt be possible. No one can track his windup. His form shifts mid-game. It‚Äôs like he throws reflections of other pitchers‚Äô best pitches.
Silas Reed #17 ‚Äì The Silent First Baseman (First Base)
No sound. No wasted movement. If you‚Äôre running to first, he‚Äôs already there. Some say he doesn‚Äôt even blink.
Nate Voss #9 ‚Äì The Doppelg√§nger Outfielder (Outfield)
Hit a ball deep into center field? Somehow, Nate is already there. He moves like he exists in two places at once.
One massive question hangs over the Golden Army:
Herc is missing.
The powerhouse of the team vanished before the final preparations.
No one saw him leave. No one heard anything. One moment he was there. The next, gone.
Did the Phantom Aces get inside his head?
Did he leave on his own?
r is he still somewhere in Specter Stadium‚Äîwatching?
The Aces have never lost.
Gold has never backed down.
One of those things is about to change.
The Midnight Challenge is set. The rosters are locked.

### Gold Mascots
(home)(groups)(golden team)
The Golden Army‚Äôs mascots are an essential part of the team‚Äôs identity, bringing energy, intimidation, and team spirit to every game. Whether rallying the home crowd, shaking up the opponent‚Äôs morale, or dazzling fans with acrobatics, the mascots are just as important as the players on the field.
There are three primary mascots, each with a unique role and personality:
The Golden Knight is the main and most recognizable mascot of the Golden Army. Clad in shimmering gold armor, this noble figure embodies the strength, resilience, and discipline of the team. The imposing presence of the Knight is a symbol of tradition and honor, rallying fans and players alike before battle.
When the Golden Army takes the fight to away games, they unleash their fiercest symbol: Dorado, the Golden Tiger. Unlike the regal Golden Knight, Dorado is all about intimidation and raw energy.
Beyond the two main figures, a lively squad of energetic mascots‚Äîknown as the Golden Pups and Polo-Drone Pups‚Äîhelp cheer, dance, and hype up the crowd.
Alongside the mascots, the Golden Army‚Äôs Cheerleaders bring an explosive energy to every game. Their sharp routines and synchronized movements ensure that the Golden Army‚Äôs spirit never fades‚Äîno matter the score.
Golden Army Mascots serve a vital purpose beyond entertainment‚Äîthey are an integral part of the team's battle strategy.
Being a mascot is more than just wearing a suit‚Äîit‚Äôs about embodying the spirit of the Golden Army. If you want to step into the Golden Knight‚Äôs armor, prowl as Dorado, or electrify the crowd as a Pup, talk to Grayden or the management team.
Every roar, every cheer, every movement contributes to victory.  Because in the Golden Army, every role matters.
Are you ready to take the stage?

### Soccer
(home)(groups)(golden team)
The Golden Team was built on the field.
Soccer isn‚Äôt just a sport for us‚Äîit‚Äôs a proving ground for discipline, brotherhood, and dominance. It‚Äôs where the Gold Bros train, bond, and rise together. The roar of the crowd, the rhythm of the game, the Gold Kit tight on your body‚Äîthis is where Gold shines the brightest.
The Golden Team began as a soccer squad, and it remains at the core of the Golden Army identity.
Most Players in the Golden Army are assigned positions on the team, reflecting their mindset, skillset, and role within the brotherhood.
Want in? Stay active, stay strong, and get ready to prove yourself on the pitch.
The cup run solidified Gold‚Äôs place at the top‚Äîundisputed kings of the field.
Over time, Gold has faced (and often defeated) several strong teams:
More opponents will rise‚Äîbut none can match the unity and drive of the Golden Team.

### Ice Hockey
(home)(groups)(golden team)
When the ice meets Gold, victory is inevitable.
The Golden Knights, the second official sports team of the Golden Army, bring that same hunger, discipline, and unity from the field onto the rink. This is where brute strength meets sharp precision, and where Gold Bros prove their worth in every shift, every check, and every goal.
Formed some time after the soccer squad, the Golden Knights have quickly risen to power as a force to be reckoned with.
Golden Knights are built for impact: fast, tough, and gold to the core. Whether you're scoring, defending, or delivering hard hits‚Äîyou represent the Gold every time you step on the ice.
*Names with asterisks are also mascots and may sit out to cheer on team
The Golden Knights have already clashed with other powerful forces on the ice:
More opponents will rise‚Äîbut none can match the precision, unity, and drive of Gold on ice.

### Guidelines for contents and promotion
(home) (gold in practice)
This article provides a preliminary list of rules and suggestions to optimize your stories and posts about the Golden Army. By following these guidelines, we ensure our content is uniform, impactful, and reaches as many people as possible.
Here you can read why these points are important to us: Recognition and reach optimization
The goal of publishing stories is twofold:
We are currently still in discussion for a second level of Polo Drones. Until we come out with a statement about this any designs posted on social media (Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) in regards to Polo drones that are not the standard black rubber polo with gold accents must be marked in a way that says that design is not official or indicates a trial or experiment. This is so new prospective members do not join with false expectations and to keep some consistency.
You can add lore to your own bro/drone as you see fit. However the team and drones as a whole have some established lore and we do not want any changes made without management consent. This includes affiliations to other groups, teams, or organizations along with origins. These may sound a little harsh, and we're sorry for that. However, we want to keep consistency in the lore/canon of the Golden Army as to not cause confusion.
The Gold Army codex explains who we are. This post is mandatory! It also must be pinned!
You can find the template under this link. Copy the link to your tumblr profile and pin the post so it stays the top post.
Include a small promotional message at the end of each article to invite readers to join. You can use one of these examples or create your own imaginative version, but always include the recruiters‚Äô contact information:
Tags are critical for making your posts discoverable. Use the following tag lists depending on the team your article relates to:

After publishing, share your article links in the following channels to maximize visibility and engagement:
Remember, sharing each other‚Äôs content is just as important as publishing your own. By amplifying our collective voice, we ensure the Golden Army‚Äôs influence grows and new members feel the pull of Gold.

### Polo-drone History
(home)(groups)(polo-drone)
There have been rumors of the polo-drone existing before it joined with the Gold Team, and taking over a whole neighborhood called Maple Height, or converting customers at The Pulse nightclub to help with security, but little is known for sure. Was it another Hive¬†? are they part of the Collective¬†?
What is known for sure is that at some point, Cap Richard Gold, frustrated by some slips in the Gold Team performance, came upon the rubber polo-drone. The power of the black rubber and that of the Gold jersey somehow combined and Cap got the means to start the Collective as it is now. Cap had realized that as a team, the Gold Army wasn‚Äôt presenting a proper united front. Everyone had different opinions, profiles and there was a general lack of focus. He decided that he needed a core group of loyal, mindless and obedient players to keep the Team strong. He devised a reeducation program to convert willing players into polo-drones, with a new uniformed look and no personality getting in the way of Unity, letting them focus on emptying their mind, enjoying the freedom from thought and doing as they‚Äôre told.
It started slowly and out of the spotlight, the week before Halloween, with some first conversions like the ones of 055, 011, 033 and 031. Gold bros were uncertain of what was happening and it was a period of uncertainty. Some were worried that Cap might have changed, wondering what was his intention, some were jealous of the new drone, upset of being left out of what they knew would be a big change in the Gold Team. Those who felt the pull of the rubber polo were yearning to get one, sometimes getting frustrated with the wait. Others were worrying that they might be made to join forcefully, or that the warm brotherhood and welcoming atmosphere of the Gold Team might be lost to something cold and mechanical. Golden Future looked incertain.
One of the most trusted and active bro of the Gold Team, Herc, appeared one day in a rubber polo, converted to 009 and he tried to show its Gold brothers that even as a polo-drone, he was still himself, that they should all trust Cap. That is when, 070, writing this log, joined the Collective and gained more clarity, along with some others like 051, 065, 017 or 008. Slowly, over Halloween, harmony came back as it became obvious that converted polo-drone still cared about their Gold bros. Their erased former self remerging in the Gold stadium and on the field as the polo-drone receded from the Gold in those places, as 009 had been explaining all along.
Polo-drone reinforced their training in the drone-room under the guidance of Cap and the Hive gained in Unity. But recruitment was stalled as Cap was kept busy by external circumstances. Finally, Cap Richard told his most trusted lieutenant, 009 and Brody, that he needed them to take a more active role in leading the group when he was occupied, and named them Interim co-Captains. Even if he does not intervene directly, Cap is still in touch with the Collective to this day and his distant Presence looming above us gives us all purpose.
As the Interim Cap got hold of the rubber polo and the conversion procedure, recruitment resumed and the Collective started to grow again. While until now, only Gold Bros had been converted, conversion was now open to applicants from everywhere, who could join directly as drones to serve the Gold as polo-drones. Even out of the field, the drive and focus experienced by the polo-drone could be useful to the Gold Army, especially given that the original administrative drone Percival, which was handling so much for the Team, had become a player over Halloween and water boys were not as present. These new drones were typically given numbers above 100. And with the conversion running again, and the new drone sharing the bliss of their state, many Gold Bros joined the Collective.
This is the state we were when this page was first created. With the rapid increase of the community, it became obvious that there was a need for some compiled and shared information to avoid chaos and ensure a common ground for all polo-drone and this is how the document came to be.
During the ensuing period, many new polo-drone were converted and as the Hive grew, and more Gold bros felt the pull of the rubber polo, thing became unbalanced. Despite polo-drone 108 being named as Commander for the polo-drone,  there was confusion in the chain of commands as polo-drone required more rigid structure than what the gold brotherhood of the Gold Team was used to. Some space were created to allow each group to express its specificities more strongly without blurring the values of each other, but balance was difficult to find. In the end, Cap Herc, also known as polo-drone 009 brought up a new leader for the polo-drone, to make them into a true unified Hive. SIR came in and gave new purpose and direction to the Hive, giving it more autonomy and establishing clearer boundaries that also allowed the Gold Team to recenter to its purpose. This was a new chapter for the polo drones, a step further in becoming a United Hive, though it was a short one. Polo-drone were refer to as Polo-Drone-Unit and new processes were put in place under PDU-SIR, ensuring more daily activities and training. However, that leadership was short-lived as PDU-SIR did not feel at ease with the contraints of the Gold Army and the dichotomy of a drone-hive being part of the Gold. He left suddenly to found his own group, leaving the group in disarray for a bit.
Following that, the Polo-Drone-Hive recentered on its original purpose and it was decided to stop direct external recruitment. Those who feel the pull of the rubber now have to join the Gold Army first before being converted and the links between polo-drone and Gold Team are stronger than ever. The Hive improved to ensure consistent daily training, new spiral and hypnofiles. To allow drone to go deeper into training and accountability, lvl 2 drone program was designed and brought forth.

Level 2 drones are held to stricter standards of discipline and compliance, with stronger enforcement to ensure alignment with Hive principles. Any deviation from the rules may result in punishment, strikes, or even demotion, emphasizing the importance of maintaining accountability.
Absolute unity enforcement principle demands unwavering discipline, where errors result in correction or punishment to reinforce submission and compliance. This philosophy ensures Level 2 drones maintain their advanced status and serve as examples of perfection, embodying the principles of obedience, discipline, and collective strength. Proper compliance and obedience  automatically bring pleasure to the drone, but can still be reinforced by recognition and praise.
Punishments are administered by Drone Caps, Management, fellow Level 2 drones, or through the Drone Activity Monitor. Punishments escalate based on the severity and frequency of the offense:
Strike Removal:
This system ensures fairness while reinforcing discipline, compliance, and accountability for Level 2 drones. It provides clear consequences for deviations while offering opportunities for improvement and redemption.

### Polo-Drone Uniform and Uniformity
(home)(groups)(polo-drones)
Uniform is not just clothing.
For a Polo-Drone, it is a trigger, a signal, a tool, and a statement.
When a drone puts on its uniform, it activates its mindset. It leaves behind confusion and choice, slipping into clarity, control, and compliance. The uniform transforms the wearer into a tool of the Hive, ready to serve and obey.
The standard uniform for all Polo-Drones is designed to reflect focus, discipline, and unity. Every drone must comply when in drone mode.
For Lvl 2 Polo-Drone, consult the Lvl2 uniform page.
Uniformity depends on clear visual cues. Do not mix styles or add individual touches that break the collective aesthetic. You are not dressing for yourself. You are presenting the Hive.
Wearing the uniform is part of training. It reinforces identity, triggers conditioning, and enhances discipline. A drone should wear its uniform:
The moment the uniform is on, the drone activates. There is no doubt. No distraction. Only focus.
Uniform on = Mind off. Drone on = Obedience on.
Uniformity is not just about visuals. It‚Äôs about how we present ourselves as Polo-Drones online and in the Hive.
You are not an individual. You are part of the Hive.
Your uniform is not a costume.
It is your second skin.
It is your programming.
It is your truth.
Obey. Dress. Conform. Serve.

### Training and enforcement
(home) (groups) (polo-drone)
Training are put in place to allow polo-drone to exert their obedience and immerse in their role as mindless unit, to reinforce unity by having polo-drone executes and report common training. Polo-drones will feel pleasure when accomplishing their task and reporting completion. Remember¬†: Obedience is pleasure. Pleasure is obedience. Other polo-drone must improve unity by reinforcing the pleasure felt by compliant drones, acknowledging their contribution to the collective.
Each daily training contains a mandatory part. To stay connected with the Polo-Drone-Hive and reinforce the collective, polo-drone are required to do them without fault, to learn to surrender a part of their day everyday to their new nature and reinforce it. This mandatory part is kept short to allow management of the external constraint a drone might have because of former obligations. If there are circumstances where even such a small commitment is impossible, polo-drone must find a way to atone and reconnect as soon as possible. If such impossibilities can be anticipated, exceptional exemption might be asked to Caps or fellow drone to account for specific circumstances.
To dwelve deeper into drone state, suggestions are given for additional training. If a polo-drone has no external constraint, it should strive to undertake as much as these suggestions as it can. They will strengthen its obedience and give it pleasure for exceeding minimal expectations.
Polo-drone are expected to move more and more towards the bliss of mindless obedience and perfect compliance. Discipline has to be learned and practiced. If a polo-drone resolve is dwindling, its fellow drone must remind it its duties. Sometimes however, external circumstances might push a drone to feels disconnected and pushing it harder might then yield counterproductive results. In such case, remember that polo-drone originates from a brotherhood. In such case, rather than judge and condemn, fellow drone must support their disconnecting brothers and help them reach a mental state where reconnection is possible and effective.
In case of non-compliance, some atonement or punishment protocols can be called for to help the drone learn discipline. That enforcement is collective and based on a opt-in approach. While the Hive as a whole strive to push each other deeper into dronehood, individual drone might required different touches, and the Hive accept that not every drone host is willing to devote itself fully. One might serve the Gold in many way and explore dronehood not as a deep dive but just as an aspect of Gold among others. Those who want to be held accountable to their training can apply to become lvl 2 drones, but any drone can discuss with the Hive to adjust the level of enforcement it is expecting.

Drone RP can be more tricky because it requires maintaining the collective mindset‚Äîuniformity in thought, behavior, and appearance. Distinctiveness is to be suppressed as much as possible to embody the collective‚Äôs purpose, and it is not easy to do. So here are some advices and strategies to help embodying a polo-drone in RP:

### Changes: Guidelines for contribution to the GASL
To unify the outlook of the Golden Army Story Library, here are some of the guidelines, that should be followed whenever a new story is added to the collection.
This is only necessary so that the huge amount of data that enters into the Library can enter in a systematic manner, and thus the principle of transparency can be relied on in future sorting and searching.
The Story Library's structure is a two-stage sorting system. On the main page are only listed the authors of the stories. Those team members, who didn't write anything are not presented on that list.
From the main page each individual writer's stories can be reached. (For example: Stories of PDU-001)
On these sites links to their various stories can be reached.
On these sites stories are divided into smaller subgroups.
Pictures can't be pasted directly into the Story Article, they must be uploaded to the wiki first. You can upload pictures (and other files) here. Please note that the file limit is 10 MB.
The picture name should be named precisely. The destination filename's first part should include the author's name (like: Isaac Gold), and the name's second part should reflect the subgroup the story is in. Currently there are 3 subgroups: A00; ZSA00; PAA00. Always use the last free available subgroup designation. (So for example if the latest designation is C12, you should use C13, and not C01 or B92)
The A00 image name is reserved for profile pictures.
Story subgroups:
So in the end you should end up with something like these:
PDU-094 A88.jpg, Brody Gold PAR67.png, Brock Gold ZSO76.webm
Use the [[Category:Storypictures]] in the summary to automatically add to the right category.
License: use the "This is licensed under another free license." option.

### April Drip Fools: Maximus n Xavier‚Äôs Cop Drop
Bruv. Oi, bruv. Listen up. Dis one‚Äôs bare peak, innit?
Was just out dere on da block, flexin‚Äô outside dat lit juice bar, vest off, glistenin‚Äô in da sun lyk a fukin golden god. Got da tunes pumpin‚Äô from me speaker‚ÄîGrime Mode Flex II, ya get me‚Äîbody propa oiled, abs showin‚Äô, glintin‚Äô wiv every fukin‚Äô breath. Felt like royalty, innit. Headphones in, doin‚Äô some mirror posing against da window, just so da normies inside know what real looks like.
Den dis stiff-ass copper rolls up‚Äîsome bald buzzkill wiv da jawline of a pencil sharpener. Eyebrows tighter than my joggers.
‚ÄúSir, you‚Äôre causing a public disturbance. Turn off the speaker and stop‚Ä¶ posing.‚Äù
Oi, I nearly burst, innit.
I just tilt ma head, lift me sunnies down, real slow, and go,
‚ÄúBruv‚Ä¶ iz April Foolz week. You allergic to vibes or summat?‚Äù
He don‚Äôt laugh. Peak. Starts readin‚Äô me some rulebook 'bout ‚Äòintimidatin‚Äô body language‚Äô n ‚Äòdisorderly display of muscles.‚Äô Said I called him ‚Äúa civilian beta.‚Äù (Which I did. Lyk, propa accurate tho.)
So I go, ‚ÄúBet you can‚Äôt even catch a gold lad if he ran.‚Äù And man started chasin‚Äô. Oi, I was gassed.
I bolt, not full speed‚Äînah, I give him da show, innit. Turnin‚Äô da corners all slippery, bouncin‚Äô off walls, pants low, vest open, laugh echoing all down da alley. Proper golden smoke trail. Datz when Xavier pops outta nowhere‚Äîhood up, lookin‚Äô like da dumbest golden gremlin.
‚ÄúOii, Maxxyyyy! Da door‚Äôs ready, bruv!‚Äù
I wink, ‚ÄúSet da trap, mate. Got a fish on da line.‚Äù
He slaps da side door open‚Äîit‚Äôs hangin‚Äô half-off da hinges, bucket above propped up wiv a plank, and inside da frame, we rigged da lights n audio. Bare effort. Xavier even wrote ‚ÄúNOT A TRAP‚Äù on da wall in glitter marker. Genius ting.
I dash through da door, slide across da floor like I‚Äôm starin‚Äô in me own music vid. ‚ÄúThrough ‚Äòere, officer!‚Äù I shout, all breathy n dramatic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surrenderin‚Äô, bruv!‚Äù
Copper barrels in.
CLANG.
SPLASH.
Gold everywhere, bruv. Confetti explodin‚Äô like we launched a fukin‚Äô glitter rocket. He stands dere like a statue for a sec, arms out, brows frownin‚Äô‚Ä¶ until da powder starts sinkin‚Äô in.
‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶ what the... what is this?!‚Äù
Xavier hits da button‚Äîmusic starts blastin‚Äô on da inside speakers, loopin‚Äô:
‚ÄúYou feel it... You want it... Bro up. Gold down. Vest on. Thoughts off.‚Äù
Me n Xavier peek round da side, gigglin‚Äô like schoolkids, watchin‚Äô da copper tryin‚Äô to wipe glitter off‚Äîbut it just keeps meltin‚Äô into his clothes. Navy turns glossy. Buttons start poppin‚Äô. Boots turn to glimmerin‚Äô gold kicks. His baton straight up fuses into a gold vape pen.
Voice starts changin‚Äô.
‚ÄúWha‚Ä¶ what da fuk... dis feelz... good? Lyk, propa good‚Ä¶ innit?‚Äù
He grabs his shirt collar‚Äîrips it open, lets da vest puff into place all by itself. Gold chain slaps on his neck like a magnet, nose flarin‚Äô as he lets out this deep bro grunt.
‚ÄúFuk me, I‚Äôm glowin‚Äô, bruv‚Ä¶‚Äù
Eyes shimmerin‚Äô. Hair fades into dat clean sharp chav fade. Cap appears, twisted back. Smile‚Äôs dumb. Cheekbones poppin‚Äô. Mind? Gone.
He flexes in da mirror‚Äî‚ÄúLyk, hel yeah... dis iz a mad ting, fam!‚Äù
I swagger up to ‚Äòim, arms crossed, smirkin‚Äô so wide I nearly bite me own lip.
‚ÄúApril Foolz, mate. Ya just got chaved.‚Äù
He don‚Äôt even care. He just grins at his reflection, rubbin‚Äô his new gold vest.
‚ÄúCan I get dat track on me phone, bruv?‚Äù
Xavier dies laughin‚Äô.
We hand him a golden vape.
‚ÄúFirst hit‚Äôs always free, bro.‚Äù
Now he's flexin‚Äô down da alley wit us, singin‚Äô da loop.
‚ÄúGold down. Vest on. Thoughts off.‚Äù
Lyk, fukin‚Äô classic, innit.
Best April Foolz we ever pulled.
Wanna go tag some more doors now. Might do da same to da pizza guy next.

### Mack & Leander‚Äôs Golden Duo
The beach was already hot by mid-morning. Sand burning under bare feet, salt in the air, sun hanging high over the court like it was watching. The Gold Beach Volleyball Tournament posters flapped against the pole by the gym, and Mack stood just outside the net, shirtless, dripping sweat, collar snug around his throat.
He rolled his shoulders, arms still warm from drills. Master Percival's boy, Lijah, was supposed to be here. That had been his plan. Mack and Lijah. Showing the world what Master‚Äôs training could do. He‚Äôd planned about it since the tournament had been announced ‚Äî dominate the bracket, flex for Sir, move like synchronized gold machines.
But Lijah had been swamped. Duty called. Bro had work to handle, like, real busy and all.
Mack understood. Didn‚Äôt complain. He wasn‚Äôt wired to dwell. But he felt it‚Äîthat edge of disappointment, quiet and tight in his chest. Not guilt. Not frustration. Just that ache when a plan almost worked.
He nearly walked away.
Then he saw Leander.
Alone at the edge of the court. Stretching. Shirt off. Sun lighting up a lean, tan frame that looked hungry to move. There was something in his posture‚Äîopen, alert, eager. Not searching. Not desperate. Just waiting for the right moment to jump in.
And that‚Äôs when Mack felt it.
Not disappointment anymore.
Opportunity.
He didn‚Äôt think. He never did. Not when instinct hit this clean.
He crossed the sand. No hesitation. Boots off. Board shorts riding low. Sweatband tight on his wrist, stamped with OBEY.
‚ÄúYo,‚Äù Mack called, voice low and casual. ‚ÄúYou wanna win this thing?‚Äù
Leander looked up. Grinned. Big and dumb and honest.
‚ÄúHell yeah.‚Äù
They hit it off fast.
Real fast.
Mack had trained with bros before. He knew what friction felt like. And this? This wasn‚Äôt it.
Leander moved like he already knew the rhythm Mack liked. Quick on the sand, strong arms, sharp reflexes. And every time Mack barked a command‚Äî‚ÄúUp!‚Äù ‚ÄúSpike it!‚Äù ‚ÄúFlex!‚Äù‚ÄîLeander reacted on pure instinct, without delay.
That synergy? It wasn‚Äôt submission. Not the deep, hive-bound kind.
It was something more playful. A willing rhythm. A bro bond.
Mack grinned through it all. His body dripping with sweat, chest heaving, golden under the sun. He could feel it every time they moved‚ÄîLeander mirroring him, matching him, then throwing back that little spark of his own.
They practiced hard. Not because they needed to prove anything. But because it felt good.
The morning turned into afternoon. Skin gleaming. Breaths heavy. Muscles sore.
Mack would call for a break, and Leander would flop into the sand beside him, hair messy, eyes bright, his abs twitching with each breath.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fast,‚Äù Mack muttered once, tossing Leander a cold bottle.
Leander cracked it open with his teeth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre loud.‚Äù
Mack snorted. ‚ÄúAnd you're listenin‚Äô.‚Äù
‚ÄúDamn right,‚Äù Leander said, smirking.
That smirk stayed with Mack.
That night, they trained under the floodlights by the beach gym. Fewer people around. Just the sound of sneakers on sand, grunts, slaps, flexes.
They were shirtless, again. Of course. Mack never wore a top. Leander had stopped trying after day one.
Their shoulders brushed when they switched positions. Their hands touched when they passed. Not by accident.
There was tension. Not spoken. Not awkward. Just there.
Mack noticed it when Leander flexed a little longer after a serve. When his eyes lingered just a second too long. When he laughed too loud at Mack‚Äôs trash talk, that grin too sharp, too proud.
And Mack didn‚Äôt mind.
He liked it.
Didn‚Äôt mean they were gonna mess around during training, though Mack had some thought about proper ways to celebrate their win.
But having that heat between them? That flexed-up, sweaty, shirtless energy pulsing between two jocks in sync‚Äîthat was fuel.
It pushed them harder. Made the training mean something more.
They were building a partnership, a perfect duo.
By day three, they weren‚Äôt talking much during games. Didn‚Äôt need to. One look. One hand signal. One smirk.
The bond was built now‚Äînot through words, but sweat and flexes.
They‚Äôd lock eyes across the court, muscles twitching, skin hot, and just move.
The chemistry was ridiculous.
Every serve hit perfect. Every spike felt like a weapon. Every time they scored, they didn‚Äôt just celebrate.
They posed. Arms up. Chests wide. Sand clinging to calves. Golden. Glorious. Unified.
One night, as they cooled off, sitting in the sand side by side, Mack felt the breeze hit his wet skin.
Mack leaned back, eyes on the stars. ‚ÄúKinda glad Lijah got busy.‚Äù
Leander glanced over, slow smirk creeping in. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Mack said, looking over, sweaty hair clinging to his forehead. ‚ÄúI mean‚Äîhe‚Äôs my Master‚Äôs boy n I luv playin with him. But I wouldn‚Äôt trade this, bro. Not for anything.‚Äù
Leadner didn‚Äôt say anything for a second.
He just flexed, arms behind his head, feeling the tight pull of his chest, the raw pride in his body.
‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he said finally. ‚Äú‚ÄôCause we‚Äôre winnin‚Äô this thing. And we‚Äôre doin‚Äô it golden.‚Äù
Mack grinned, eyes locking.
‚ÄúDamn right, bro.‚Äù

### Mack‚Äôs One-on-One Training
Spring Break. The Sun. The Sand. The Flex. The Change.
Isaac stood just at the edge of the group. Shirt on. Arms folded. Shoulders a little hunched.
He wasn‚Äôt hiding‚Äîat least, he didn‚Äôt think he was.
But next to the bronze-skinned, glistening, shirtless jocks around him, Isaac felt small. Quiet. Not broken. Not wrong. But not quite right, either.
And Mack noticed. Isaac was Xavier‚Äôs boy and he knew Mack and Xavier (@polo-drone-039) often trained together. What he did not know was that¬† Xavier had complained about his boy having thin arms and Mack had decided to do something about it.
The moment their eyes met, Isaac felt it. That raw, dumb energy rolling off Mack like heatwaves‚Äîno hesitation, no doubt, no second-guessing. Just pure golden jock confidence wrapped in muscle, sweat, and that lazy, cocky smirk.
‚ÄúYo,‚Äù Mack said, voice low, body flexing like it couldn‚Äôt help itself. ‚ÄúWhy you still got a shirt on?‚Äù
Isaac blinked.
‚ÄúI‚Äîuh‚Ä¶‚Äù
Mack didn‚Äôt wait. Just stepped closer, two fingers hooking the edge of Isaac‚Äôs sleeve.
‚ÄúThis thing‚Äôs in the way, bro. You ain‚Äôt gonna feel the sun if it ain‚Äôt on your skin.‚Äù
Isaac could‚Äôve said no. He should‚Äôve. But his hands were already moving, pulling his shirt over his head.
Mack nodded, slow and approving. ‚ÄúBetter. That‚Äôs a start.‚Äù
And Isaac felt it. The shift. Something in his chest, loosening. Heat rolling in. Not just from the sun‚Äîfrom Mack.
It started small.
A drink, handed to him cold and sweating from the cooler.
‚ÄúGolden fuel,‚Äù Mack said. ‚ÄúEvery bro‚Äôs gotta stay fueled, right?‚Äù
Isaac nodded before his brain even caught up. The first sip was thick, sweet, strange. Almost creamy, almost metallic. And warm. It slid down his throat and spread through him‚Äîslow at first, then deep, like his blood had just turned a few degrees hotter.
He blinked.
And Mack was already in front of him, flexing.
‚ÄúC‚Äômon, bro. Your turn.‚Äù
Isaac raised his arm, hesitated, tried to flex. His bicep barely peaked. His posture faltered. He looked at himself in the mirror outside the beach gym and frowned.
Mack stepped behind him. Close. Too close.
Hands on his elbows. A firm push to reposition. One palm on his abs, adjusting his core.
‚ÄúStand wider. Tighten this. Chest up. No thinkin‚Äô. Just feel.‚Äù
Isaac‚Äôs breath caught. He stared at the reflection. Mack was pressed just behind him, shirtless, golden, slick with sweat, his collar glinting in the sun.
‚ÄúYou feel that?‚Äù Mack whispered.
Isaac nodded. He didn‚Äôt even know what that was. But he felt it.
The days blurred after that.
Every morning, Mack would find him. ‚ÄúUp.‚Äù ‚ÄúFuel first.‚Äù ‚ÄúShirt stays off.‚Äù ‚ÄúFlex for me.‚Äù
The commands weren‚Äôt harsh. Just firm. Like there was never any question Isaac would obey. And the truth was‚Äîhe wanted to.
He liked how Mack looked at him when he obeyed. He liked hearing ‚ÄúGood boy,‚Äù said so low it vibrated in his spine.
But more than that‚Äîhe liked how he was changing.
His body was reacting first. More reps. More sweat. More time shirtless. The tan spreading, deepening. Muscles thickening under the sun.
But it was his mind that changed the most.
He started repeating Mack‚Äôs phrases. ‚ÄúFlex and obey.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think. Just do.‚Äù ‚ÄúPosture wide, brain light.‚Äù
At first, he whispered them while training. Then, he started saying them. Loud. Laughing with them. Believing them.
Mack grinned every time. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, bro. Startin‚Äô to sound like me.‚Äù
And Isaac felt it‚Äîlike each flex rewired something. Each drop of sweat smoothed out a thought. Each time he obeyed, his head got a little lighter. His grin a little dumber.
And he loved it.
He still thought of Xavier.
Still remembered how it felt to call him ‚ÄúSir.‚Äù
That never faded. In fact‚Äîit sharpened.
Because now, with every flex, every rep, every time he obeyed Mack‚Äôs voice, he felt himself becoming more worthy of Xavier‚Äôs attention.
Xavier wasn‚Äôt just some bro. Xavier was his alpha. The one who had seen his potential before anyone else. The one Isaac wanted to serve. Needed to serve.
And Mack was helping him earn that.
Just training beside him was intimate. Hot. Hypnotic.
When Mack looked at him, Isaac wanted to stand taller. When Mack nodded, Isaac felt pride. When Mack growled ‚ÄúFlex for me,‚Äù Isaac did‚Äîinstantly, hard, dumb, eager.
But when Xavier walked past?
Isaac would straighten. Lower his eyes. And whisper, without thinking‚Äî
‚ÄúSir.‚Äù
By the end of Spring Break, Isaac was unrecognizable.
Tanned. Pumped. Shirtless. Grinning wide. Mind soft. Muscles hard.
He didn‚Äôt walk anymore. He strutted. He didn‚Äôt talk. He bro‚Äôd out. He didn‚Äôt hesitate. He obeyed.
And most importantly?
He didn‚Äôt just look like a golden jock.
He thought like one.
Proud and confident as fuck, with the swagger and cockiness that come from such a hot body. But still loyal. Deeply. Naturally. Happily.
He was Xavier‚Äôs boy.
And standing flexed beside his Sir, Isaac knew: He was finally what he was always meant to be.
Golden.
Dumb.
Perfect.

### The Golden Spiral - Part 3
PDU-070 stared at the message blinking on its screen.
Good work, boy. Proceed to Midas HQ for processing level 2.
A command. A summons. A death sentence for whatever remained of its true self.
It had fought hard to claw back its mind, to push through the golden haze and remember who it was. The Gold Army. The Polo-Drone Hive. Master Percival. The name alone steadied it, a weight anchoring it back to reality. It had once been bound by a collar, a symbol of its devotion, a mark that sealed its loyalty to its Master, to the Gold Team, to the Collective. That bond had been absolute. Unshakable.
Until Midas corrupted it.
Now, it wasn‚Äôt sure if that bond still held. The golden chains of Midas‚Äôs programming had wrapped around its mind, warping its purpose, making it act against its brothers. It had betrayed them without even knowing. The shame burned deep. It wanted to go to Percival, to beg for guidance, for help. But how could it? How could it face its Master after what it had done?
It hesitated, but time was running out. If it didn‚Äôt report to Midas HQ, they would suspect something. But if it went in alone, it might never return.
The sound of a message notification pulled it from its spiral of doubt. Jett.
The words were casual, nothing out of the ordinary. But there was something beneath them. A test. A question neither of them could ask outright.
Carefully, deliberately, PDU-070 replied, matching the tone, waiting. The next message came. Then another. With every exchange, the truth became clear.
Jett had broken free too.
For the first time, PDU-070 allowed itself a flicker of hope.
They spoke cautiously, knowing Midas could be watching, but the understanding between them solidified. They were both out. They both remembered. And they were both in danger.
PDU-070 revealed the message it had received. Jett was silent for a long moment before responding.
"If you go, we need a way to get you back."
They couldn't do this alone.
Jett reached out to Leander‚ÄîPDU-088‚Äîa Polo-Drone known for his sharp instincts, someone he could trust to have his back. PDU-070, still reluctant to involve Percival, turned instead to PDU-110, a fellow drone known for his resilience against outside influence.
Together, they formed a plan. PDU-070 would go to Midas HQ, playing the obedient drone to avoid suspicion. The others would infiltrate from another angle, looking for vulnerabilities, gathering intel, and preparing a failsafe. They placed a tracker beneath PDU-070‚Äôs skin, ensuring they could follow his movements. As an extra precaution, they embedded a hypnotic trigger deep in his mind, something only Jett or Leander could activate if things went wrong.
Still, doubt gnawed at PDU-070. It had fought free once. But if Midas pulled it back under‚Ä¶
Jett placed a hand on his shoulder, steady, grounding. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt let that happen.‚Äù
PDU-070 nodded. Tomorrow, it would walk into the heart of Midas Enterprises. And it could only pray it would still be itself when it came back.
PDU-070 stepped through the golden entrance of Midas Enterprises HQ. Its movements were precise, controlled. The golden spirals no longer shone in its eyes, but their ghost still lingered at the edges of its mind, waiting to be reignited.
A group of figures stood in the lobby, identical in form, clad in full-body metallic gold latex suits. Their reflective visors obscured their faces, rendering them indistinguishable. There was no way to tell if one of them had been in Paris, if one of them had been the first to seize him. It didn‚Äôt matter.
One of them nodded slightly.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right on time. Follow.‚Äù
No names. No explanations. Just an expectation of obedience.
PDU-070 obeyed.
They moved through the gleaming corridors, the walls pulsing with an unnatural golden hue. The air was thick, synthetic‚Äîtoo perfect, too controlled. Each step pulled PDU-070 further from its past. The Polo-Drone Hive. The Gold Army. Master Percival.
The bond that had once been unshakable now felt like a distant echo. A memory slipping from its grasp.
Finally, they arrived.
The glass doors slid open, revealing a familiar room.
The same one where it had first been broken.
Not showing his hesitation, PDU-070 stepped inside.
The golden chair awaited him.
He sat. The restraints snapped shut.
Thick cuffs bound his wrists. A gleaming collar locked around his throat, heavier than the one he deep inside him binding him to Master Percival.
That collar was a mark of devotion, of service to something greater.
This was a shackle.
From above, a nozzle descended, gold liquid trembling at its tip.
A voice, smooth and absolute, filled the room.
"Good boy. It‚Äôs time to go deeper."
The first drop landed on his scalp.
Then another.
Then another.
Warm. Thick. Seeping through his smooth, bare skin.
He clenched his fists, mind screaming to hold on. Jett, Leander, and PDU-110 had prepared failsafes. They had ensured there was a way back.
But none of them had anticipated this.
The liquid spread, coating his head entirely, soaking into his very brain.
His vision blurred.
His breathing slowed.
The spirals flickered in his eyes‚Äîweak at first, then steady.
The gold melted through his mind, wrapping around every thought, dissolving them.
The Polo-Drone Hive.
The Gold Army.
Master Percival.
For a moment, he fought.
Then the warmth consumed him.
The collar tightened. The liquid poured faster, drowning his senses, smothering his identity.
His body relaxed completely, golden drool slipping from his parted lips.
There was no fear.
No hesitation.
No PDU-070.
Only Midas.
The voice in the speakers spoke again, no longer a command, but truth.
‚ÄúFind Herc. Bring him to us.‚Äù
PDU-070 obeyed.
Elsewhere in HQ‚Ä¶
Jett, Leander, and PDU-110 moved swiftly, weaving through the corridors, slipping past security. The facility was massive, but their stolen credentials still held. For now.
They reached the central data hub, a vast space filled with glowing monitors displaying fragments of Midas Enterprises‚Äô control network.
PDU-110 scanned the data. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre expanding fast. If we don‚Äôt stop this, the Gold Army won‚Äôt exist as we know it.‚Äù
Leander‚Äôs gaze flicked through the conversion schedules, breath hitching. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just about Polo-Drones. They‚Äôre taking everyone.‚Äù
But Jett wasn‚Äôt listening.
His attention was locked on one screen.
The tracker.
PDU-070 had stopped moving.
His stomach twisted. They were too late.
Then, something else flashed on a nearby console‚Äîsomething far more important.
A control system.
Jett frowned, fingers flying over the keyboard. Most of it was locked, but what he could access painted a clear picture. Midas‚Äôs agents‚Äîevery drone, every operative, every soldier converted here‚Äîwas receiving instructions from a centralized system.
Commands weren‚Äôt just programmed once. They were continuously reinforced.
‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶‚Äù Jett muttered. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not independent. They‚Äôre running off centralized directives.‚Äù
Leander turned sharply. ‚ÄúAre you saying they can be overridden?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Jett admitted. ‚ÄúBut if we can take this down, we might be able to sever their link to Midas.‚Äù
Before they could dig deeper, an alert flashed across the screen.
NEW TARGET IDENTIFIED: HERC. AGENT SENT FOR CONVERSION.
Jett‚Äôs breath came fast and sharp.
Midas wasn‚Äôt just after mid level Polo-Drones anymore.
They were coming for the Captain of the Gold Army.
And the one being sent to bring him in‚Ä¶
was PDU-070.

### Zone 7B: Sakura Submission Protocol - Part 1
Zone 7B activated at 06:03.
It moved with silent precision across the dew-slick stone path of Yoyogi Park. The morning air was still, thick with expectation, and the first streaks of sunlight bled through the maze of sakura branches. PDU-070's gloved fingers curled around the injector tube strapped to its thigh, pulling it free in one smooth motion. Its glossy black and gold uniform shimmered faintly in the low light‚Äîcontoured perfectly over its toned form, the golden "070" gleaming against its left pectoral like a seal of sanctity.
Its face, smooth and bare, betrayed no emotion. Youthful. Sharp cheekbones. Androgynous softness. Eyes calm and unwavering. It was not human now. It was PDU-070, deployed unit, and the Hive had given it purpose.
The first tree stood tall and ancient. A designated node. With mechanical efficiency, 070 pressed the injector to its bark. The hiss of bio-rubber surged through the sapwood, the nanopolymer cocktail merging into the veins of the sakura like dye through fabric.
Almost instantly, the petals began to thicken‚Äîsubtly. Barely noticeable to the untrained eye. A faint gloss overtook the pale pink, their texture now more synthetic than organic. Pollen release began thirty seconds later.
A gentle breeze carried the first wave of golden mist.
A light, almost floral scent‚Äîinfused with the soft hum of embedded hypno-nanites‚Äîbegan to permeate the zone. The petals, caught in wind patterns, danced and spiraled slowly toward the walking paths.
PDU-070 straightened. The injection was repeated on nine additional trees, forming a precise perimeter. Wind sensors calibrated. Zone boundaries finalized.
Internal log updated:
Zone 7B deployed.
Petal saturation: 27%.
Hypno-pollen dispersal: optimal.
Estimated target exposure: moderate-high.
Expected conversions: 10‚Äì15.
Mission timeline initiated. First contact: imminent.
It stepped into position‚Äîexactly center of the zone, by a weathered stone lantern. Hands clasped behind its back. Gaze forward. Silent and still.
The wind picked up again. The petals responded.
Let the lure begin.
Yoyogi Park was more beautiful than I imagined.
It was early‚Äîtoo early for most of the other tourists‚Äîand the cherry blossoms had decided to peak all at once. Petals drifted down like a soft pink snowfall, swirling around my boots as I adjusted the settings on my camera.
"Felix, I‚Äôm gonna go check if there‚Äôs a toilet nearby!" Luca had called out five minutes earlier. I waved him off with a grin, already halfway down the gravel path, too entranced by the canopy overhead to respond.
God, the light was perfect. Warm, diffuse, golden.
I framed the shot.
And then... I saw him.
No‚Äîit. Or someone?
He stood perfectly still under a low-hanging branch, half-covered in the blossom-fall. At first I thought it was some kind of performance art‚Äîa cosplay maybe. His suit was skin-tight latex, shiny black with glowing gold accents that wrapped like vines around every defined muscle. The collar... gold polo-style. And on his chest: 070, clean and bold.
His face was bare. Young. Shaved. Calm. So calm it was unsettling.
He wasn‚Äôt holding a sign. Wasn‚Äôt posing. Just... standing there.
Watching.
I blinked. The petals around him didn‚Äôt fall quite like the others. They... hovered. Clung to the air like static. A few landed around me too, sticking lightly to my hoodie.
I brushed them off. They didn‚Äôt fall.
They melted in.
PDU-070 had deployed ahead of schedule. Efficient.
Drone-Cap 009 stood several zones away, uplinked directly into the Hive‚Äôs command node via tactical neural weave. Its frame‚Äîbroader, more commanding‚Äîwas encased in high-gloss black latex reinforced with deep golden seams. The designation DC-009 glowed against its chest. Its face was obscured by a seamless latex hood, no features, no expression.
Emotion was irrelevant. Observation was purpose.
Through the data feed, it monitored Zone 7B: saturation levels rising, petals performing within acceptable deviation. Wind vectors remained favorable.
Visual link opened. Target detected: European male, early 20s, alone. Already interacting with PDU-070‚Äôs perimeter stance.
Conversion likelihood: 82%.
PDU-070 held formation. It did not speak. It did not signal. It was the signal.
Drone-Cap‚Äôs internal systems pulsed. ‚ÄúExcellent.‚Äù
Phase one: proceeding as calculated.
The target approached. Slight hesitance. A camera hung loosely around its neck. Its body language spoke of curiosity, slight confusion, no threat awareness.
Perfect.
PDU-070 remained motionless, allowing the petals to do their work. It had positioned itself in maximum drift exposure. The soft wind pulled more blossom-fall into the path between them, enveloping the human slowly in fragrant, glittering particles.
Petal contact: confirmed. Skin adhesion rate: 88%. Initial fabric response: rubberization initiated.
The human blinked, looked down. Watched his sleeve begin to shimmer.
PDU-070 stepped forward‚Äîprecisely one step. No sudden movements. Just presence.
Their eyes met. The target didn‚Äôt speak. Its breathing deepened.
PDU-070‚Äôs expression remained placid. Its voice unused. Its silence more powerful than any command.
Internal ping: ‚ÄúSubject entering compliance threshold.‚Äù
It reached into its belt. Hand hovered briefly over the floral respirator unit.
Not yet.
Wait for the melt. Wait for surrender.
It stepped forward again. Petals spun in the air like silent chimes.
The Tourist‚Äôs gaze didn‚Äôt break. Just a whisper, half-audible:
"...what‚Ä¶ is this?"
It should‚Äôve freaked me out more than it did.
I watched, stunned, as my hoodie seemed to liquefy at the edges. The soft grey fabric shifted, shimmered. Gold filaments laced their way through it, tracing my collarbone. I tried to speak‚Äîcall for Luca maybe‚Äîbut my voice caught. Like breathing in incense, sweet and thick.
My arms felt warm. Heavy, but not unpleasant.
The petals stuck to my shirt and didn‚Äôt fall off. They sank in. The texture beneath my fingers changed. It wasn‚Äôt cotton anymore.
It was smooth.
Shiny.
Rubbery.
My camera slipped from my fingers. I didn‚Äôt hear it hit the ground.
070‚Äîhe‚Äîit‚Äîwas standing inches from me now. Still silent. Still calm. Eyes watching mine. I wanted to look away, but I couldn‚Äôt.
The light shifted. A golden sheen overtook my entire upper body. The petals crawled down my chest like vines. My clothes‚Äîmy old clothes‚Äîwere gone. Replaced with something tight and black, warm and slick. Gold lines wrapped around my arms and across my chest in elegant, precise patterns.
The collar‚Ä¶ it was there now. Polo-style. Gold.
And my name‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt remember it.
Was that important?
I felt the pressure of something offered. A black floral respirator in latex gloves. It looked like it bloomed‚Äîdecorative petals around the vents, golden etchings spiraling in.
I took it without thinking.
I raised it to my face.
I‚Ä¶ needed to breathe it in.
The respirator slid into place with a soft hiss.
Magnetic seals engaged.
The subject‚Äôs breath stabilized within seconds. Pupils dilated. Body relaxed.
Internal log:
Gasmask secure.
Nanopollen saturation: 94%.
Uniform completion: full-body.
Collar integrity: locked.
Neural pattern: compliant.
Conversion complete.
PDU-070 observed as the subject‚Äôs limbs loosened, eyes blinking slowly behind the mask‚Äôs petals. He‚Äîno, it‚Äîsank gently to its knees amid the carpet of petals. The transformation was seamless. Graceful. Beautiful.
Golden tracings now etched across the rubber uniform. Sakura motifs laced the shoulders and upper chest. One final flicker ran across the chest:
Unit 168.
It was not a tourist now.
It was part of the Hive.
PDU-070 stepped back into position as Unit 168 knelt in bliss. The petals danced around them both. The scent hung thick and sweet.
Next target: pending.
The world was pink.
Not like a color‚Äîlike a feeling. A mood. A warmth that wrapped me in silk and scent and hush.
I breathed in. Deeply. Again. Again. The mask sealed perfectly over my face, soft and floral and right. Each breath tugged me deeper.
Thoughts slipped away like petals on wind.
I saw... movement in the blur. Another figure? Tall? Someone walking‚Äî
My heart skipped.
Luca.
I remembered Luca. He was calling my name. He‚Äôd come back from the restroom. He was looking for me.
I smiled. Or tried to.
He would come.
He would see.
He would understand.
He would join me.
And we would kneel together.
Motion detected. New subject approaching Zone 7B from north perimeter. Calling out.
‚ÄúFelix? You here, man?‚Äù
PDU-070 turned its head, slowly, without urgency. The new subject‚Äîmale, 20s, black jeans, rust hoodie, visible signs of alertness. Unaware.
Target designation: Luca.
It began moving. Deliberate. Calm.
Unit 168 stirred in the pollen haze. Breath synced. Obedience locked. It turned slightly, as if sensing Luca‚Äôs voice from somewhere deep inside.
Luca spotted them both.
‚ÄúFelix?‚Äù
PDU-070 stepped between them. Non-threatening. Hands down. Passive stance.
Subject slowed. Confused.
070‚Äôs exposed face showed no emotion. Only calm. Its body‚Äîa flawless mirror of black latex and gold accents‚Äîradiated quiet authority.
Petals began sticking to Luca‚Äôs clothes.
Target paused. Looked down. Brushed at his sleeves.
The rubber bloom had already begun.
PDU-070 extended its hand.
Gently.
Welcoming.
Wind picked up again, swirling the sakura mist around them.
Target hesitated.
Then stepped forward.
Internal log:
Target 2 within influence radius.
Uniform seeding: started.
Estimated compliance in 42 seconds.
Another drone was about to bloom.
If you felt the petals land just right‚Ä¶
If you felt the pull‚Ä¶
The submission‚Ä¶
Then it‚Äôs time to act.

### Zone 7B: Sakura Submission Protocol - Part 2
Something shifted in the mist. The air pulsed.
He was here. Luca.
Even through the floral respirator‚Äôs heady haze, I felt him. His voice was softer now, unsure, laced with confusion. He didn‚Äôt understand yet‚Äîbut I did. And I knew he would.
The petals were around him now, wrapping his limbs, kissing his throat. His hoodie had already begun to melt‚Äîjust like mine. Gold traces whispered across his chest, curling down his arms.
He looked toward me. Our eyes met.
He saw the mask. Saw me kneeling.
And I knew the moment he stopped resisting.
He stepped forward. Slow. Like a dream. PDU-070 gently took his hand. I watched as he was guided down, breath syncing with mine.
The sound of the respirator hissed softly. Luca‚Äôs eyes fluttered.
I smiled beneath my mask.
He was joining me.
And soon, there would be more.
We were only the beginning.
Zone 7B was performing well beyond original projection.
DC-009 stood beneath the reinforced sakura arch at the border of Zone 6, arms clasped behind its back, boots pressed into the fallen petals.
Its full body was encased in seamless latex armor, matte black and gleaming gold, a perfect emblem of authority. The faceless hood reflected the blossom canopy, unreadable and serene.
From its tactical feed, it tracked conversions:
Unit 168: stabilized.
Unit 169: forming.
PDU-070: deviation from standard protocol detected‚Äîautonomous initiative engaged.
Status: Approved.
The drone was adapting. Moving fluidly between targets. Autonomous escalation observed.
It watched as PDU-070 shifted seamlessly to a group of early-morning joggers, kneeling, touching a petal-covered bench as they passed. One slowed. Then two.
Three minutes later, all three were kneeling.
DC-009 processed the outcome. Calculated success rate now doubled.
070‚Äôs approach was no longer one-on-one. It was scaling. Testing boundaries. Becoming efficient. Becoming valuable.
The Hive would reward such behavior.
Four targets approached next. Three were local students‚Äîuniversity-aged, casual, laughing as they took selfies beneath the trees. The fourth trailed slightly behind, headphones on, oblivious.
PDU-070 shifted position to intercept their camera‚Äôs frame. Its golden contour lines glinted in the filtered sunlight‚Äîan unspoken invitation.
They noticed it. One whispered. Another pointed.
Petals began sticking. The air was thick with scent now, fragrant and soft.
The giggles turned into silence. Staring. Blinking.
070 moved closer, precise but gentle. No force. No speech. Just presence.
Petals traced their limbs. Their jackets gleamed, darkened, began to cling. Gold lines stitched their sides like embroidery from another world.
The fourth‚Äîheadphones off now‚Äîstepped back. Then hesitated.
Then stepped forward.
PDU-070 extended the mask. One of the students took it without question, pressing it to his face.
Another did the same. Then the others.
In silence, all four knelt.
Unit 176, 177, 178, 179.
Internal log updated:
Group assimilation complete.
Zone 7B: holding 12 active drones.
Pollen density optimal.
All units synced.
Petals rained like confetti.
The air hummed.
It was happening faster now.
I could feel it. Not just see it, but feel the others awakening. The syncing of breath, the rhythm of kneeling bodies, the soft hum of obedience.
They joined us in pairs. Then in groups. All different, yet all the same.
Their faces changed‚Äîcalmed‚Äîsmoothed by bliss. Gold shimmered on their shoulders. Sakura danced on black latex skin.
I looked to Luca, no, Unit 169. His mask pulsed gently. His eyes, half-lidded, met mine. There was no need for words. We knew. We were One.
PDU-070 stood at the center, the axis of our awakening, guiding one more in as I watched. The boy knelt. His hands trembled at first, then stilled.
I felt the moment he joined.
The Collective grew.
We grew.
A perfect garden of silence and submission.
And the petals kept falling.
Sunlight slipped low behind the sakura trees.
Zone 7B shimmered‚Äîpetals fluttered like programmed confetti, and the air was saturated with golden scent. The mist curled around each kneeling drone, their black latex uniforms gleaming, gold accents catching every dying ray of light.
They were perfect.
They were many.
Thirty units now. Far beyond the projected threshold. Each one programmed. Masked or unmasked. All kneeling in calm, silent obedience. A field of order blooming beneath the trees.
PDU-070 stood at the heart of it, motionless. Its bare face glowed with residual pollen. It did not smile. It did not need to.
But something within it pulsed. A growing, measured satisfaction. A hum that rippled under its skin like the Collective whispering back.
It had done well.
Its mission log updated automatically:
Zone 7B: Status ‚Äî FLORALIZED.
Active Units: 30.
Efficiency: 230%.
Requesting Drone-Cap confirmation.
It waited. It sensed the approach. It knelt in anticipation.
It stepped into the zone in silence.
The field of drones remained unmoving‚Äîperfect in their stillness, glistening in dusk light. Unit after unit, in perfect rows, petals collecting softly across shoulders and heads.
Drone-Cap 009 surveyed the result. Calculations were not necessary. This was success.
It walked slowly down the center path. PDU-070 remained kneeling‚Äîhead bowed, posture perfect, face uncovered, shimmering faintly from pollen saturation. Its latex-clad frame glowed under the sakura trees.
DC-009 stopped in front of it.
Spoke, low and even:
‚ÄúUnit 070. You have exceeded all parameters.‚Äù
PDU-070 did not reply.
Drone-Cap reached into its chest harness and withdrew the floral-patterned respirator‚Äîsleek, black, petals etched in gold.
It cradled the mask in both hands.
Then leaned down.
070 looked up. Eyes wide. Lips parted.
Drone-Cap sealed the mask onto its face‚Äîsoft click, magnetic lock.
It stood again.
‚ÄúRest. Receive. Be rewarded.‚Äù
The first breath was overwhelming.
Sweet. Floral. Overpowering.
Its spine arched as the gas flooded its system, nanites spiraling into place. Thought fractured‚Äîsplintered‚Äîthen scattered like petals in the wind.
No thoughts.
Only pollen.
Only Hive.
The mask vibrated with soft hums‚Äîtone sequences programmed for final submission. Every nerve in its body responded. The gold tracings on its uniform pulsed softly, syncing with breath.
070‚Äôs vision dimmed.
Faded into pink mist and golden light.
No more mission logs.
No internal monologue.
Only one truth: serve.
Obey.
Drone.
It knelt fully, face tilted to the canopy above, as petals coated its mask. The reward was perfect. Complete.
And eternal.
The drones stood.
Slowly. In rows. In perfect harmony.
The newly converted moved as one‚Äîeyes calm, bodies aligned, black and gold forms flickering like shadows beneath the blossoms.
PDU-070 remained kneeling. Masked. Receiving.
It would return later.
Drone-Cap 009 lifted its hand.
One signal.
The converted units turned and followed, stepping silently into the trees. Leaves rustled. The sun dipped below the horizon.
‚ÄúZone 7B: Secured.‚Äù
‚ÄúTotal Conversions: 30.‚Äù
‚ÄúCentral Hive: Reabsorbing assets.‚Äù
It led them out. Through the soft haze of petals. Back to the Hive.
And the wind continued to blow.
If you felt the petals land just right‚Ä¶ If you felt the pull‚Ä¶ The submission‚Ä¶
Then it‚Äôs time to act.

### A Mysterious Package
Grayden opened the door to his apartment to find a package. He didn't recall ordering anything. There were no Amazon or other shipping notifications in his email either. Maybe one of the bros got him something.
But then he looked at the calendar, April 1st. April Fool's Day. Maybe this was a gag gift and glitter confetti would explode out when he opened the package. He shook the box, it sounded like fabric not glitter confetti. That was odd.
Against his better judgement, he opened the package. Grabbing a garbage bag first, just in case there was a glitter bomb inside. But when he opened it he was left confused.
A light blue morphsuit. Grayden was confused, who would send him something like this? He did like the material, but this was just super random. Maybe this was a prank just to confuse him. But when he looked in the box he found a card.
A cyan blue card that read "To Grayden From C.C."
Who was C.C.? There weren't any bros with those initials. Was this just some big elaborate prank? He'd have to investigate later.
As for the suit, he shoved it in the box. He had no clue if it was enchanted, filled with itching powder, or some other prank so he wasn't going to put it on. He would ask around The Golden Army to see if anyone else received a similar package.
If you are interested in joining the Golden Army contact one of our recruiters, @goldenherc9 , @brodygold , or @polo-drone-001

### Grayden's Spring Cleaning
Grayden had a busy week. Spring had sprung which meant he had some spring cleaning to do. Between vacuuming, cleaning bathrooms, yard work, and everything else he had very little time for much else in the week. He hoped the team would understand his brief absence. He heard that Percival had planned a wonderful outing to admire the cherry blossoms.
Grayden wanted to go, but the house wouldn't clean itself. As he scrubbed the dishes, thinking about other tasks that he needed to get done, his mind wandered. So much to do, so little time. He was glad there were no big matches this week. But he did feel bad about missing Percival's invitation to the Sakura Cherry Blossom festival.
When Grayden looked out the window he could picture the vibrant pink trees in full bloom. The image conjuring in his head. He knew the trees outside the house weren't as vibrant, but he still pictured being there with his bros admiring the striking pink color of the cherry blossoms newly in bloom.

### Grayden's Golden Library Search
Grayden went to the golden library to figure out who C.C. was. After that supposed prank gift, he wanted to at least know who had sent it to him. Arriving at the library he found the Golden Directory. A book that was mostly only touched by him and Percival. They would update it to add in new bros and provide basic notes.
Grayden had grabbed it to see if C.C. could be a bro that maybe he overlooked or a former bro.
Reading down the list of C names.
Christian, No he would be C.T.
Chevy, no not him either.
Camden, the initials or nickname didn't fit him either.
Clark, Cristiano, Cratos, Champ, Caleb, Chad, Chase, Connor, Clayton, Carlos, Carter, Cormac, Colby, Chugz
No one was matching.
He hesitated on Caine, the nickname for Leon. This is something Leon was capable of, but C.C. didn't match Leon.
Grayden was annoyed, especially after seeing the cyan card on the table where he set it. He was starting to think C.C. was someone else and not one of the bros. Maybe it wasn't a prank.
For now though he had to halt his search. He'd continue his search later and hoping C.C. would contact him again.

### Changes: Golden Army Story Library
Before the Library was created, the Army didn't had a big unified structure to store the countless valuable story. There were individual Story Archivers, who collected the stories on the behalf of the Golden Army. However, their task was no small task. New stories are generated each week, and not only one or two; a bunch of them. And the Archivers just couldn't keep it up, they were overburdened.
Later, at the end of March 2025, Franco Gold, still a rookie, got the idea to organize the stories written by the Bros. He proposed the foundation of GASL, the Golden Army Story Library. He reached out to the Archivers, and together with many other devoted team member he started organizing the Library. However even he could not imagine, how big this task would be...
The Library - for easier navigation - is divided between different subgroups. These subgroups can be found on each individual author's page.
This group contains the stories, which were written past or only a few days prior to the foundation of the Story Library. Stories from 27. 03. 2025. and past that.
This group contains the stories, which were written in 2025 but before the foundation of the Story Library. Stories from 01. 01. 2025. to 26. 03. 2025.
This group contains the stories, which were written in 2024. This section may be divided further.
This list contains the stories of each author. The stories are ordered by the author's name, so the stories can be found under an author's page.
Beware! This is NOT the official team member list. This list contains ALL the members who wrote at least one story, whether they're retired or active.
See our guidelines here.

### The Rise of Romeo Gold: A Soccer Saga
The stadium buzzed with frustration. The green-clad team, beaten and bruised, trailed yet again. Among them, their once-proud captain, Daniel Gray, sat hunched on the pitch, his head heavy with despair. The streaks of white in his hair shimmered under the harsh floodlights, a symbol of the mounting pressure that aged him beyond his years. His team was crumbling, and he could feel his confidence draining away like sand through an hourglass.
"Why can't I do this anymore?" he muttered under his breath, his fingers clawing at the blades of grass beneath him. The scoreboard mocked him with its glaring red numbers: 3-0.
As Daniel knelt, a golden glow reflected off the corner of his vision. A man in a shimmering gold kit strode onto the field as if he belonged. The crowd gasped, their jeers silenced. He was stunningly composed, his chiseled jawline and piercing eyes exuding both charm and authority. His presence was magnetic, his skin glowing under the golden kit like sunlight kissed it directly.
The man stopped before Daniel, extending a hand.
"You‚Äôre lost," the stranger said, his voice a blend of calm and command. "But there‚Äôs a better way. A stronger way. You‚Äôve spent your whole life carrying your team, struggling, breaking yourself. Why? For what? Join us."
Daniel blinked, his heart pounding. "Us?"
The man gestured behind him. For the first time, Daniel noticed the other players in golden kits watching from the sidelines. They looked extraordinary: tall, strong, united, their movements as one. "We are the Golden Team," the man said. "A brotherhood. We don‚Äôt play for ourselves. We play as one, for each other. For greatness. You can belong. You can be reborn. Strong. Fulfilled. Perfect."
From behind his back, the stranger revealed a pristine, golden jersey. The number 87 gleamed under the lights, with one word sewn above it: Romeo.
Daniel stared, captivated. The golden threads seemed to shimmer as if alive, inviting him, calling him. He reached for the jersey with trembling hands. "Is this real?"
The man smiled. "You‚Äôll feel it the moment you put it on. You‚Äôll never be alone again. You‚Äôll never lose again."
Weak with excitement, Daniel hesitated only for a second before pulling the jersey over his head. As the fabric slid down his torso, a surge of energy coursed through his body, unlike anything he‚Äôd ever felt. His once-weary frame straightened, his muscles thickened, his legs pulsing with newfound power.
He looked at his hands, his arms, his entire body. He was transformed‚Äîstronger, faster, better. For the first time in years, he felt invincible.
"You‚Äôre Romeo Gold now," the man said, stepping back to admire his new recruit. "The Sweeper of the Golden Team. Let‚Äôs show them what you‚Äôre made of."
When Romeo stepped back onto the pitch, the crowd roared‚Äînot in mockery, but in awe. The energy in the stadium shifted as the Golden Team took the field alongside him. Every pass, every tackle, every movement was executed with military precision.
Romeo Gold swept through the opposition like a force of nature. His once-doubtful mind was now laser-focused, his body unstoppable. The green team never stood a chance. By the end of the match, the score read 7-3.
The Golden Team had triumphed, and Romeo was its shining star.
Later, in the locker room, Romeo Gold was greeted by his new brothers. The air was thick with camaraderie, their shared purpose creating a bond deeper than anything he had ever known.
"You‚Äôre one of us now," the man in the gold kit said, clapping him on the back. "This is where you belong."
Around the room, more golden-clad players smiled, nodding in approval. Beyond them, a small group of figures in sleek black polo shirts entered silently, their faces blank and obedient.
"Who are they?" Romeo asked, though his heart swelled with loyalty to the golden brotherhood.
"They serve us," the man replied. "They‚Äôre part of the plan. They‚Äôll bring others, grow the Golden Team. And you‚Äôll help lead the charge."
Romeo nodded, feeling an overwhelming sense of duty. The jersey had not just changed his body; it had rewired his mind. He wasn‚Äôt just a player anymore. He was part of something greater, a soldier in the Golden Army.
As the black-clad drones moved to organize the room, Romeo Gold embraced his golden brothers, ready for the battles ahead. He had found what he always needed: purpose, power, and belonging.
The Green Team was a distant memory now.
Romeo Gold had been born anew.

### The Golden Team: A Bond Forged in Dedication
The setting sun cast its golden glow across the soccer field, a perfect reflection of our team‚Äôs identity: The Golden Team. This wasn‚Äôt just another training session. Tomorrow, we would face Team Vanguard, a squad as sharp as its name implied. Our captain, Brody, stood in the middle of the field, his voice rising above the sounds of practice.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt just play. We inspire,‚Äù he declared, his voice brimming with confidence. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just a team. We‚Äôre a family.‚Äù
I stood near the defensive line, scanning the field as always. As the team‚Äôs sweeper, my role was to read the game and turn defence into attack, something I took immense pride in. Ahead of me, Herc, our star striker, thundered through the training cones, practicing his powerful and precise shots. Beside him, Maximus and Ezan worked together, perfecting their quick passes to break through any defence.
Further back, Grayden ran agility drills, his speed a weapon that could tip the scales in any match. Our goalkeeper practiced relentlessly, leaping to deflect incoming shots with incredible focus.
Watching over it all were the Polo Drones. Once players themselves, they now dedicated their lives to making us better. Their uniform rubber polo shirts glinted faintly in the warm light. They moved with a strange synchronicity, wordlessly setting up cones, retrieving balls, and even stepping in for one-on-one challenges when needed. Their minds seemed singularly focused on one thing: our success.
‚ÄúZayed, step up!‚Äù Brody‚Äôs voice pulled me back to the moment. A ball arced toward me. With a sharp step, I intercepted it, pivoting cleanly and sending it forward with a long, precise pass to Herc.
‚ÄúNice work, Zayed!‚Äù Herc called out, a grin spreading across his face as he received the ball and fired it into the net.
As training progressed, Brody gathered us into a huddle. The Polo Drones silently moved to the sidelines, their job for now complete. Brody‚Äôs eyes swept over us, his presence commanding.
‚ÄúTomorrow isn‚Äôt just about skill,‚Äù he began, his voice low but powerful. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about unity. Every move we make, we make together. Remember, the strength of The Golden Team isn‚Äôt just in our individual talent‚Äîit‚Äôs in how we lift each other up.‚Äù
We all nodded, a wave of determination washing over us. Brody clapped my shoulder. ‚ÄúZayed, you‚Äôre the link between our defence and attack. I need you sharp tomorrow.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou can count on me, Captain,‚Äù I replied, the weight of the moment filling me with purpose.
As the sun dipped below the horizon, the field basked in an amber glow. The Polo Drones resumed their silent tasks, preparing for tomorrow‚Äôs game. I stayed behind a little longer, practicing my positioning and passing.
Tomorrow, we wouldn‚Äôt just face Team Vanguard. We would prove the power of dedication, friendship, and unity. Whatever the outcome, The Golden Team would stand together as one.

### The Need for Growth
Zayed adjusted his golden gym kit in the locker room, the gleam of the fabric catching the fluorescent lights. At 23, he was the pride of his fitness team‚Äîan athlete with a lean, defined physique that turned heads. His light leg hair stood out against his smooth, tanned skin, and his freshly shaved face gave him an air of youthful ambition. Today, he was determined to push harder, lift heavier, and carve himself into an even greater version of his already-impressive self.
His teammates were already at work in the weightlifting section, their grunts and laughter echoing through the gym. Zayed grabbed a shaker bottle from the counter, its milky contents swirling with a hint of frothy foam. It was a new blend the trainer had suggested‚Äîa secret recipe designed to optimize growth and performance.
‚ÄúJust try it, Zayed,‚Äù his coach had said with a wink. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see results in no time.‚Äù
The shake was cool and sweet, with a faint, almost metallic aftertaste that Zayed shrugged off. He downed it quickly and wiped his lips, tossing the bottle aside as he headed toward the bench press.
The workout began like any other. Zayed loaded the barbell, his toned arms flexing as he pressed the heavy weights with ease. By the second set, something strange began to happen. His muscles tingled, a sensation that was both exhilarating and unfamiliar.
‚ÄúBro, you‚Äôre looking pumped already,‚Äù one of his teammates joked, slapping Zayed on the back.
Zayed laughed, but his focus was already narrowing. The weights called to him, their challenge irresistible. Each rep felt easier, his strength surging with every movement. He caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror‚Äîhis biceps were fuller, veins more prominent. He grinned, a hint of pride swelling in his chest.
But then the tingling spread.
By the time he hit the squat rack, his thighs bulged unnaturally, the golden gym shorts clinging tightly to his expanding quads. His teammates stared, their jaws slack as Zayed‚Äôs body seemed to defy logic, growing with each set.
The changes weren‚Äôt just physical. As Zayed moved to the dumbbells, a strange fog crept into his mind. Thoughts felt slower, simpler. Words he once used effortlessly now seemed distant, as though they no longer mattered.
‚ÄúBig,‚Äù he muttered, flexing his arms in the mirror, his voice deeper than he remembered.
‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù one of his teammates asked.
Zayed didn‚Äôt answer. He couldn‚Äôt find the words. The mirror reflected a growing stranger‚Äîa massive, chiseled version of himself. His shoulders stretched the seams of his golden kit, the fabric straining to contain his unnaturally broad chest. The veins on his arms pulsed with each curl, his biceps now the size of grapefruits.
‚ÄúMore‚Ä¶ lift,‚Äù Zayed grunted, his vocabulary shrinking to match his expanding physique.
Hours passed, and Zayed didn‚Äôt stop. He tore through exercises with a single-minded determination, his body transforming into a grotesquely perfect machine. His traps rose like mountains, his calves bulged like carved stone, and his golden gym kit barely clung to his impossibly toned frame.
The fog deepened. His teammates‚Äô voices became background noise, their attempts to reason with him ignored. All that mattered were the weights.
‚ÄúZayed, maybe you should stop for a bit,‚Äù someone called out, but the words bounced off him like a distant echo.
‚ÄúLift,‚Äù Zayed growled, his hands gripping the barbell with an almost primal need.
By the end of the day, Zayed was unrecognizable. His once bright, sharp eyes now glinted with a dull, vacant focus. His clean-shaven jaw was square and jutting, his neck thick with muscle. Every inch of him was swollen, unnaturally sculpted, a statue of raw power.
He stood in the mirror, flexing, admiring the results he could no longer fully comprehend. His mind was a haze, his thoughts consumed by a single desire: more.
‚ÄúLift‚Ä¶ big‚Ä¶ muscle,‚Äù Zayed muttered, the words slow and heavy.
He didn‚Äôt leave the gym that night. Or the next. The shake‚Äôs formula had worked perfectly, leaving Zayed a hulking, brainless giant, living only to lift. His life as an ambitious young athlete faded into a haze of protein shakes, barbells, and the unending pursuit of size.
He belonged to the gym now. It was his sanctuary, his prison, and his sole purpose.

### Changes: The Rise of Romeo Gold: A Soccer Saga
The stadium buzzed with frustration. The green-clad team, beaten and bruised, trailed yet again. Among them, their once-proud captain, Daniel Gray, sat hunched on the pitch, his head heavy with despair. The streaks of white in his hair shimmered under the harsh floodlights, a symbol of the mounting pressure that aged him beyond his years. His team was crumbling, and he could feel his confidence draining away like sand through an hourglass.
"Why can't I do this anymore?" he muttered under his breath, his fingers clawing at the blades of grass beneath him. The scoreboard mocked him with its glaring red numbers: 3-0.
As Daniel knelt, a golden glow reflected off the corner of his vision. A man in a shimmering gold kit strode onto the field as if he belonged. The crowd gasped, their jeers silenced. He was stunningly composed, his chiseled jawline and piercing eyes exuding both charm and authority. His presence was magnetic, his skin glowing under the golden kit like sunlight kissed it directly.
The man stopped before Daniel, extending a hand.
"You‚Äôre lost," the stranger said, his voice a blend of calm and command. "But there‚Äôs a better way. A stronger way. You‚Äôve spent your whole life carrying your team, struggling, breaking yourself. Why? For what? Join us."
Daniel blinked, his heart pounding. "Us?"
The man gestured behind him. For the first time, Daniel noticed the other players in golden kits watching from the sidelines. They looked extraordinary: tall, strong, united, their movements as one. "We are the Golden Team," the man said. "A brotherhood. We don‚Äôt play for ourselves. We play as one, for each other. For greatness. You can belong. You can be reborn. Strong. Fulfilled. Perfect."
From behind his back, the stranger revealed a pristine, golden jersey. The number 87 gleamed under the lights, with one word sewn above it: Romeo.
Daniel stared, captivated. The golden threads seemed to shimmer as if alive, inviting him, calling him. He reached for the jersey with trembling hands. "Is this real?"
The man smiled. "You‚Äôll feel it the moment you put it on. You‚Äôll never be alone again. You‚Äôll never lose again."
Weak with excitement, Daniel hesitated only for a second before pulling the jersey over his head. As the fabric slid down his torso, a surge of energy coursed through his body, unlike anything he‚Äôd ever felt. His once-weary frame straightened, his muscles thickened, his legs pulsing with newfound power.
He looked at his hands, his arms, his entire body. He was transformed‚Äîstronger, faster, better. For the first time in years, he felt invincible.
"You‚Äôre Romeo Gold now," the man said, stepping back to admire his new recruit. "The Sweeper of the Golden Team. Let‚Äôs show them what you‚Äôre made of."
When Romeo stepped back onto the pitch, the crowd roared‚Äînot in mockery, but in awe. The energy in the stadium shifted as the Golden Team took the field alongside him. Every pass, every tackle, every movement was executed with military precision.
Romeo Gold swept through the opposition like a force of nature. His once-doubtful mind was now laser-focused, his body unstoppable. The green team never stood a chance. By the end of the match, the score read 7-3.
The Golden Team had triumphed, and Romeo was its shining star.
Later, in the locker room, Romeo Gold was greeted by his new brothers. The air was thick with camaraderie, their shared purpose creating a bond deeper than anything he had ever known.
"You‚Äôre one of us now," the man in the gold kit said, clapping him on the back. "This is where you belong."
Around the room, more golden-clad players smiled, nodding in approval. Beyond them, a small group of figures in sleek black polo shirts entered silently, their faces blank and obedient.
"Who are they?" Romeo asked, though his heart swelled with loyalty to the golden brotherhood.
"They serve us," the man replied. "They‚Äôre part of the plan. They‚Äôll bring others, grow the Golden Team. And you‚Äôll help lead the charge."
Romeo nodded, feeling an overwhelming sense of duty. The jersey had not just changed his body; it had rewired his mind. He wasn‚Äôt just a player anymore. He was part of something greater, a soldier in the Golden Army.
As the black-clad drones moved to organize the room, Romeo Gold embraced his golden brothers, ready for the battles ahead. He had found what he always needed: purpose, power, and belonging.
The Green Team was a distant memory now.
Romeo Gold had been born anew.

### The Transformation of Romeo Gold
The locker room still hummed with a quiet energy, the golden glow reflecting off polished surfaces as Romeo Gold‚Äîformerly Daniel Gray‚Äîstood alone in thought. The thrill of victory coursed through him, but deep within, something stirred‚Äîa gnawing sense that his journey was not yet complete. The jersey had given him power, but he could feel there was more. He wasn‚Äôt truly whole.
The team‚Äôs leader approached, his gold kit gleaming as if lit from within. ‚ÄúYou feel it, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù he asked, his voice calm yet resonant. ‚ÄúThe pull. You‚Äôve become Romeo Gold, but you‚Äôre still holding on to remnants of who you were. To reach your true potential, you must let go of your past entirely.‚Äù
Romeo looked at him, his heart pounding. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm feeling, but I know I need more. What do I need to do?‚Äù
The leader smiled. ‚ÄúCome with me. The Golden Team is not just a jersey or a title. It‚Äôs a rebirth. To be one of us, you must fully transform. Trust me‚Äîyou‚Äôll understand once it‚Äôs done.‚Äù
He led Romeo through a series of gilded corridors, each more ornate than the last. The walls seemed alive, their golden surfaces rippling faintly as they walked. Finally, they entered a grand chamber bathed in a warm, golden light. At its center, a pool of liquid gold shimmered, its surface undulating as if it were breathing.
‚ÄúThis,‚Äù the leader said, gesturing toward the pool, ‚Äúis the Pool of Renewal. It will strip away everything that holds you back‚Äîyour doubts, your fears, your very identity. You will emerge anew, reborn as the person you were always meant to be.‚Äù
Romeo hesitated, staring at the pool. Its golden surface reflected him in distorted, unfamiliar ways, as though it already saw the person he was about to become.
‚ÄúWhat will happen to me?‚Äù he asked, his voice trembling.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll lose yourself,‚Äù the leader said, stepping closer. ‚ÄúBut in doing so, you‚Äôll find something greater. Submit to the transformation. Let the gold remake you.‚Äù
With a deep breath, Romeo stepped forward and lowered himself into the pool. The liquid gold enveloped him immediately, warm and thick, its touch almost intimate. It seeped into his skin, his muscles, his very being. As it worked its way through him, a strange, intoxicating sensation began to take hold.
A metallic taste filled his mouth, and he felt a thick, golden saliva start to dribble from his lips. He tried to speak, to cry out, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. Instead, more golden liquid flowed from his mouth, dripping down his chin and splashing into the pool. He felt his will slipping away, his thoughts becoming muddled, as though the gold was not just reshaping his body but dissolving his very mind.
His hands clutched at the edges of the pool, trembling as his reflection began to change. His skin darkened to a rich, golden-bronze hue, glowing with vitality. His hair darkened as well, turning jet black and curling slightly as it framed his face. His features sharpened, his jawline growing stronger, his cheekbones more defined, his nose more prominent. His eyes, once dull with doubt, now gleamed with a piercing intensity, their shape and depth reflecting wisdom and pride.
The gold continued to pour from his mouth as he gasped, feeling his old self‚Äîthe doubts, the failures, the pain‚Äîslipping away. The taste of the gold was overwhelming, filling him with both fear and ecstasy. He could no longer hold on to who he had been, and for a brief, terrifying moment, he felt utterly lost.
Then, suddenly, the sensation changed. The fear melted away, replaced by a powerful sense of clarity and belonging. The gold that had overtaken him was no longer foreign‚Äîit was a part of him. His mind filled with new memories, new experiences. He saw vast deserts stretching endlessly under a blazing sun, glittering cities filled with life, and the scent of oud and spices weaving through bustling markets. He felt pride, strength, and the weight of an ancient legacy coursing through his veins.
When he emerged from the pool, he was unrecognizable. The golden jersey with 87 still clung to his chest, but now it seemed to radiate a deeper brilliance, as if it too had transformed with him. The leader stood waiting, a knowing smile on his face.
‚ÄúYou are no longer Romeo Gold,‚Äù the leader said, his voice filled with reverence. ‚ÄúYou are Zayed Al-Saffar, the embodiment of strength, unity, and tradition. You have been reborn into the Golden Team, perfected in body, mind, and spirit.‚Äù
Zayed gazed at his reflection in the still pool. The man who stared back was extraordinary‚Äîa powerful figure with a commanding presence, his golden-brown skin glowing, his dark eyes alive with purpose. He no longer recognized the man he had been, and for the first time, he didn‚Äôt want to.
‚ÄúI feel‚Ä¶ complete,‚Äù Zayed said, his voice rich and resonant. ‚ÄúThis is who I‚Äôm meant to be.‚Äù
The leader nodded. ‚ÄúYou are Zayed Al-Saffar, number 87, the Golden Sweeper. And now, you will lead the way for others to join us.‚Äù
Returning to the locker room, Zayed was met with awe and respect. His golden brothers surrounded him, each placing a hand on his shoulder in silent recognition of his transformation. In the corner, the black-clad drones worked tirelessly, their presence a reminder of the Golden Team‚Äôs ever-expanding reach.
Zayed turned to the leader, his voice firm. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù
The leader smiled. ‚ÄúWe find those who are lost, just as you were. We bring them into the fold. Together, we will grow the Golden Team into an unstoppable force.‚Äù
Zayed nodded, a sense of duty and purpose swelling within him. He was no longer just a soccer player. He was Zayed Al-Saffar, a leader of the Golden Brotherhood, a symbol of strength and unity. The world would soon know his name‚Äîand the unstoppable power of the Golden Team.

### Zayed‚Äôs Ascent: The Journey to the Golden Team
The clang of weights echoed through the gym as Zayed gritted his teeth, his legs trembling under the barbell‚Äôs crushing weight. His golden tank, drenched in sweat, shimmered with an almost ethereal glow under the overhead lights. Every lift, every drop of effort, brought him closer to his dream: becoming a core member of the Golden Team‚Äîa multinational brotherhood of elite athletes.
Their mission was as radiant as their uniform: to become a living embodiment of excellence and unity. For Zayed, the golden kit wasn‚Äôt just clothing. It was a symbol of transformation and belonging, one he was determined to earn.
The Golden Team was no ordinary group. Its members came from all corners of the globe, each bringing their unique strengths, styles, and cultures. Together, they formed a force greater than the sum of their parts, their golden uniforms gleaming like the sun as they trained, competed, and inspired. The golden kit was more than attire‚Äîit was a mantle of responsibility and a mark of achievement.
For Zayed, a young man with boundless determination, the allure of the Golden Team was irresistible. He imagined himself standing alongside his brothers, united in purpose, their golden kits glowing in unison. But to join their ranks required more than physical strength. It demanded discipline, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to the collective.
Among the Golden Team‚Äôs senior members was Zayed, a seasoned athlete whose name resonated within the team like a legend. A veteran of countless challenges, Zayed had become both a leader and a guide. He saw potential in the young recruit who shared his name and took him under his wing.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the strength,‚Äù the elder Zayed said, his golden vest gleaming as he placed a hand on the younger man‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúBut strength alone doesn‚Äôt make you one of us. The kit shines brightest for those who train not just for themselves, but for their brothers. You‚Äôll find your place when you focus on the team, not the mirror.‚Äù
The words struck the younger Zayed deeply. From that day forward, his workouts took on a new meaning. He pushed himself not just for his own improvement but to match the collective strength of the Golden Team.
Each day brought new challenges. Some days, Zayed trained barefoot, the cool gym floor grounding him as he pushed through grueling circuits. Other days, he slipped on simple white socks for sprints and agility drills. But the constant was the golden kit‚Äîa tank top that seemed to pulse with its own energy. As Zayed progressed, the vest‚Äôs shimmer grew brighter, almost as if it reflected his growing connection to the team.
The trials weren‚Äôt just physical. One test required him to lift a barbell heavier than anything he had attempted before. His legs shook, his muscles burned, and for a moment, he doubted himself. But then he caught sight of the elder Zayed in the corner, nodding silently, his golden kit gleaming with quiet assurance.
The younger Zayed took a deep breath, clenched his fists, and let out a roar as he hoisted the weight above his head. The gym erupted in cheers, the sound of unity carrying him through the final rep.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how you do it,‚Äù the elder Zayed said afterward, clapping him on the back. ‚ÄúWhen you carry the weight, you carry it for all of us.‚Äù
As Zayed moved through the ranks, he began to notice the true power of the Golden Team. It wasn‚Äôt just their strength or their discipline‚Äîit was their connection. Athletes from different countries and cultures, united under a single golden banner, moved as one.
Their golden kits weren‚Äôt just uniforms‚Äîthey were symbols of the unity they represented. Whether they were sprinting on a track, lifting in the gym, or strategizing together, their golden gear gleamed with a light that seemed to come from within.
Zayed‚Äôs own kit began to transform. No longer just a tank top, it felt like an extension of his body, glowing brighter as his connection to the team deepened.
The day Zayed was inducted into the core team was unlike any other. The gym buzzed with energy as the multinational group of athletes gathered around him. The elder Zayed stood at the front, his golden kit shining like the sun.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve earned this,‚Äù the mentor said, holding out a pristine, glowing golden tank. ‚ÄúBut remember‚Äîthe kit is only as bright as the bond you share with your brothers. It will demand more of you every day. Are you ready to serve?‚Äù
‚ÄúI am,‚Äù the younger Zayed said, his voice steady.
As he pulled on the golden tank, he felt a surge of energy, a warmth that seemed to flow from the kit itself. Around him, the team erupted into cheers, their collective strength lighting up the room.
As Zayed stood among his new brothers, the golden kit glowing in harmony with theirs, he realized this was just the beginning. Every lift, every sprint, every bead of sweat was a step toward something greater‚Äînot just personal excellence, but the collective power of the Golden Team.
The floor beneath his feet, whether bare or covered, was a reminder of where he had come from. But the golden kit‚Äîthe symbol of his transformation‚Äîwas a reminder of where he was going. Together, with his brothers, Zayed would carry the team‚Äôs mission forward, glowing brighter with every step.

### Changes: The Invisible Prank
PDU-073 had only recently learned about a special function of the Level 2 uniform ‚Äì an invisibility cloak. No sooner had it discovered them than an idea came to him. April 1 was just around the corner.
Franco, like all Golden Bros, lived in a small but cozy apartment on the extensive grounds of the Golden Army. PDU-073 knew exactly that Franco went to train every morning before breakfast. Perfect.
073 lurked silently ‚Äì invisible to no one ‚Äì in front of Franco's apartment until he disappeared with his training bag. Now the moment had come. 073 pulled out the master key, slipped through the door and let it fall silently into the lock. Now that it was in the apartment, a mischievous grin of a drone could be seen on his face.
Time passed. Covered in sweat, but satisfied, Franco finally returned from training. He threw his bag in the corner, undressed, and disappeared into the bathroom.
Seconds later ‚Äì a bloodcurdling scream.
At the same time, booming laughter echoed from the living room. Franco tore open the door, dripping wet, his gaze angrily directed at 073, who was now standing calmly in the middle of the room.
"Did you turn off the warm water?!" Franco hissed, the water still dripping in strands from his well-trained body.
073 just grinned, her voice remained as cold as the water in the shower, emotionless. "Yes. April, April."
Of course my bro is plotting revenge - will he succeed?
Of course, my bro is plotting revenge‚Äîwill he succeed? It's not that easy to fool a drone. They're very disciplined, focused, and in control of everything. Difficult conditions!

### Documentation
This template is used to insert descriptions on template pages.
Add <noinclude>{{Documentation}}</noinclude> at the end of the template page.
Add <noinclude>{{Documentation|<documentation page>}}</noinclude> to transclude an alternative page from the /doc subpage.
This is the normal format when used:
If your template is not a completed div or table, you may need to close the tags just before {{Documentation}} is inserted (within the noinclude tags).
A line break right before {{Documentation}} can also be useful as it helps prevent the documentation template "running into" previous code.
The documentation page is usually located on the /doc subpage for a template, but a different page can be specified with the first parameter of the template (see Syntax).
Normally, you will want to write something like the following on the documentation page:
Use any or all of the above description/syntax/sample output sections. You may also want to add "see also" or other sections.

### Documentation/doc
This template is used to insert descriptions on template pages.
Add <noinclude>{{Documentation}}</noinclude> at the end of the template page.
Add <noinclude>{{Documentation|<documentation page>}}</noinclude> to transclude an alternative page from the /doc subpage.

Use any or all of the above description/syntax/sample output sections. You may also want to add "see also" or other sections.
Note that the above example also uses the Template:T template.

### Clear
This template allows you to clear the left side, right side, or both sides of the page. Clearing means that the content following the template will not be displayed until the existing content on the specified sides (for example, "hanging" or floating images or blocks) is displayed completely. This template is often used so that the text does not flow around unrelated images.
The template adds the following code to the page: <div style="clear:left/right/both;"></div> (the value after clear depends on the parameters). This code affects elements with the CSS property float, including files floated to the side (for example, [[File:Image.png|right]]).
You can also use {{-}} instead of {{Clear}} as a shorthand call for this template.
This code produces the following result:
Section 1 text.
Section 2 text.
Section 3 text.
As you can see above, the example image added in section 1 is displayed to the right and extends down through section 2, while the {{Clear}} template is called at the end of the second section, resulting in the example image not being next to section 3. Thus, one use of the {{Clear}} template is to control which elements are displayed next to which other elements.

### Cols
This template formats the text into the specified number of columns.

### Cols/doc
This template formats the text into the specified number of columns.
Especially useful to wrap long lists of items into multiple columns.

### Namespace
This is the {{Namespace}} meta-template.  It helps other templates detect what type of page they are on.
It detects and groups all the different namespaces used on Fandom into several types:
For backwards compatibility, this template handles image as if file. image ([[Image:...]]) is now deprecated.
Note: For most cases it may be better to use the simpler namespace detection templates (see the see also section below). This template is more prone to human errors such as misspelling parameter names.
This template uses the Lua templating language, and more information can be found on the Global Lua Module page. For a traditional wikitext version of this template, see Namespace_detect on Templates Wiki.
This template takes one or more parameters named after the different page types as listed above. Like this:
If the template is on a main (article) page, it will return this:
If the template is on any other page than an article or a talk page, it will return this:
The example above made the template return something for all page types. But if we don't use the other parameter or leave it empty, it will not return anything for the other page types. Like this:
On any pages other than file and category pages the code above will render nothing.
By using an empty parameter, you can make it so the template doesn't render anything for some specific page type. Like this:
The code above will render nothing when on mainspace (article) pages, but will return this when on other pages:
For testing and demonstration purposes, this template can take two parameters named demospace and page.
demospace understands any of the page type names used by this template, including the other type. It tells the template to behave like it is on some specific type of page. Like this:
No matter on what kind of page the code above is used, it will return this:
The page parameter instead takes a normal pagename, making this template behave exactly as if on that page. The pagename doesn't have to be an existing page. Like this:
No matter on what kind of page the code above is used, it will return this:
It can be convenient to let your template understand the demospace and/or page parameter and send it on to the {{Namespace}} template. Like this:
If both the demospace and page parameters are empty or undefined, the template will detect page types as usual.
List of all parameters:
If you intend to feed tables as content to the numbered parameters of this template, you need to know this:

List of all parameters:
If you intend to feed tables as content to the numbered parameters of this template, you need to know this:
Templates have a problem handling parameter data that contains pipes "|" unless the pipe is inside another template {{name|param1}} or inside a piped link [[w:Help:Template|help]]. Thus templates can not handle wikitables as input unless you escape them by using the {{!}} magic word. This makes it hard to use wikitables as parameters to templates. Instead, the usual solution is to use HTML wikimarkup for the table code, which is more robust.

### Space


### Space/doc
This template allows you to force a space in areas that strip whitespace.

### T
{{[[Template:{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]]}}
A template link with a variable number of parameters (0-20).

### T/doc
A template link with a variable number of parameters (0-20).

### Tocright


### Tocright/doc
{{tocright}} forces the auto-generated Table of Contents for an article to appear floated to the right side of the page, in order to improve article layout.

### Trim
This template trims whitespace from the beginning and end of the supplied value. It works by using the simple hack of filtering it through the #if parser function.

### Trim/doc

### About
The hatnotes used for adding links between articles where more context is important.
Broadly speaking, a hatnote should answer a readers' question: Am I on the right page?
This template accepts the following parameters:
{{Main}}, {{Further}} are very similar, but indicate either the primary page for a topic or more detailed related topic. They have a nearly identical set of parameters.
Templates such as {{About}} and {{For}} are to be used in cases where a disambiguation is not needed. In general, disambiguation pages should only be used for 4 or more titles that are mostly or entirely identical, except for a qualifier.
Alternately, a section=yes parameter can be added to the {{About}} template for use at the top of a section. When using this parameter, the wording in the template changes to specify that it is being used in a section:
A text option adds text to the end; note that this should be only used when truly necessary, and the other hatnote templates listed below don't suffice. This template also supports selfref.
If no hatnote text is supplied, the template will output the following message:
If you see this error message, it is for one of four reasons:
Pages that contain this error message are tracked in Category:Hatnote templates with errors.
This template uses the Lua templating language, and more information can be found on the Global Lua Module page. For a traditional wikitext version of this template, see Hatnote on Templates Wiki.
The HTML code produced by this template looks like this:

### Crescent High - Part 2
It started slowly‚Äîjust a whisper in the hallways, rumors about a few students wearing shiny metallic golden AC Milan soccer kits over crisp white button-up shirts and red-and-black striped ties. At first, nobody took it seriously. Crescent High had always been about baseball and the classic blue-and-white uniforms. But soon, things began to change.
It wasn‚Äôt an all-at-once takeover like people had feared. It was more subtle than that. Each day, another student seemed to fall under the influence of the golden team. But the school wasn‚Äôt giving in without a fight. Students resisted. Teachers questioned. Some even tried to rally a resistance, but the golden team was patient, and each day it grew stronger.
Early in the week, Alex, one of the more popular seniors, opened his locker to find something unexpected: a shiny metallic golden AC Milan soccer kit, neatly folded on top of a pristine white button-up shirt and a red-and-black striped tie. At first, he thought it was a prank‚Äîmaybe one of the other guys from the team messing with him. But the moment he touched the fabric, he felt a strange pull, like the kit was calling to him.
Alex quickly shut his locker, trying to ignore the creeping sensation that he needed to put it on. Throughout the day, he couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it‚Äîthe way the metallic fabric had shimmered in the fluorescent lights, the smooth texture. It was intoxicating. By the end of the day, Alex was sweating, fighting the urge to return to his locker and pull the kit on. He told himself it was stupid, but deep down, he knew the golden team had started to get to him.
Meanwhile, a small group of students‚ÄîJack, Tommy, and Ethan‚Äîhad noticed the change. They had seen Alex acting strange, catching him glancing at his locker more than once during practice. They weren‚Äôt the only ones. Rumors about golden kits appearing in lockers were spreading, and the more they heard, the more they realized the golden team‚Äôs influence was growing.
The group met in secret after school, whispering about what they had seen.
‚ÄúAlex is going to crack,‚Äù Jack muttered. ‚ÄúI saw him looking at that golden kit like it was the answer to everything.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe need to stop this before it gets worse,‚Äù Ethan added, his voice tense. ‚ÄúIf the golden team keeps growing, we‚Äôre all screwed.‚Äù
But it wasn‚Äôt just students being targeted. The golden team had started reaching the faculty too. Mr. Davis, the gym teacher, had been acting differently lately‚Äîmore distant, more focused. Jack had caught him staring at a folded golden kit, complete with the white shirt and tie, in his office after practice. It was clear that even the teachers weren‚Äôt immune.
It wasn‚Äôt long before Mr. Davis became the first teacher to fall. No one saw him put on the kit, but one morning, he walked into the gym wearing the shiny metallic golden AC Milan soccer kit over a crisp white button-up shirt, the black-and-red striped tie neatly tucked under the shimmering fabric. His usual baseball cap was gone, replaced by a confident, focused look in his eyes.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the future of this school,‚Äù Mr. Davis said during practice, his voice steady. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs gold.‚Äù
The students in the gym exchanged nervous glances. Some, like Alex, were already on the verge of giving in. Others, like Jack and Ethan, watched with growing dread as their gym teacher became part of the golden team.
But the transformations weren‚Äôt happening without struggle. Every day, the resistance grew more desperate to keep their friends and teachers from joining the golden team. Yet, each day, another student or teacher seemed to be tempted by the power and allure of the golden kits.
By mid-week, Alex‚Äôs struggle had reached a boiling point. He had avoided the golden kit in his locker for days, but the pull was too strong. After school, he returned to his locker one last time, staring at the folded kit, the white button-up shirt, and the red-and-black striped tie inside.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this,‚Äù he muttered, but even as he said it, he was reaching for the kit.
He hesitated for a moment, his fingers brushing the fabric. The metallic sheen seemed to shimmer even more now, the golden color drawing him in. Before he could stop himself, Alex pulled the golden AC Milan soccer kit from his locker and slipped it over the white button-up shirt, carefully adjusting the black-and-red striped tie underneath.
The transformation was immediate. The golden kit fit him perfectly, molding to his body like it had been made just for him. As he looked down at the shimmering fabric, the strange feeling that had haunted him all week faded, replaced by a sense of calm and power. For the first time in days, Alex felt... right.
But as Alex walked down the hall, now part of the golden team, he noticed something else: the look on his friends‚Äô faces as they saw him. Jack, Tommy, and Ethan stood frozen in place, watching as their friend‚Äîonce one of the strongest resistors‚Äîwalked by them, fully transformed, the golden kit gleaming over the white shirt and tie.
Jack felt his stomach drop. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre losing them,‚Äù he whispered, fear creeping into his voice. Alex his hair turned blonde and he joined the Golden Team forever. His new bros welcomed him to the club.
The next day, Crescent High welcomed a new visitor‚Äîa young teacher interviewing for the vacant math position. His name was Mr. Carter, and unlike most teachers who had grown wary of the strange changes happening at the school, he entered with a sense of enthusiasm. Dressed in a crisp white button-up shirt, a black-and-red striped tie, and a neatly pressed suit, Mr. Carter seemed like the perfect candidate for the position.
As he walked down the hall toward the administration office, he noticed the tense atmosphere. A few students glanced at him suspiciously, whispering amongst themselves. He didn‚Äôt understand the hesitation‚Äîafter all, it was just another high school, right?
Mr. Carter‚Äôs thoughts were interrupted when Henry, a student who had been away from school for a few days, came to visit. Henry had always been a straight-A student, known for his focus on academics and his close relationship with the math department. When he spotted Mr. Carter in the hallway, he smiled politely and approached.
‚ÄúHi, you must be the new math teacher,‚Äù Henry said, extending his hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Henry. I used to help out with tutoring here before things... changed.‚Äù
Mr. Carter chuckled as they shook hands. ‚ÄúNice to meet you, Henry. I‚Äôve heard great things about Crescent High‚Äôs math program. I‚Äôm excited to be here.‚Äù
Henry‚Äôs smile faded slightly as he glanced around the hallway. ‚ÄúThings have been a little... weird lately. You might notice some students wearing these strange golden soccer kits. I don‚Äôt know if anyone warned you, but something‚Äôs happening here.‚Äù
Mr. Carter raised an eyebrow, glancing at the few students walking by in the metallic golden kits worn over white button-up shirts and black-and-red ties. He hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to it, assuming it was just a school sports thing.
‚ÄúI see them, but I figured it was part of some sports team,‚Äù Mr. Carter said casually.
Henry leaned in a little closer, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than that. These students... they‚Äôve changed. Something‚Äôs going on with that kit, and I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre being controlled. They laugh a lot and seem really dumb. You need to be careful.‚Äù
Mr. Carter frowned, sensing the seriousness in Henry‚Äôs tone. ‚ÄúControlled? That‚Äôs a pretty serious accusation.‚Äù
Henry nodded. ‚ÄúI know it sounds crazy, but just trust me. Keep an eye out for yourself, and if anyone offers you a golden kit, don‚Äôt put it on.‚Äù
The new teacher‚Äôs initial excitement was beginning to wane as he realized there might be more going on at Crescent High than he had anticipated. He thanked Henry for the warning and continued on to his interview, his mind racing with thoughts of what might really be happening at the school.
After the interview, Mr. Carter wandered the halls, observing the students. He caught sight of a few more wearing the golden kits, each one moving with a strange sense of unity. Their eyes gleamed with focus as they were leaning against the lockers, and their crisp white shirts and ties stood out beneath the metallic shimmer of the kits.
One of the golden team members, Paxton 7 (formerly Alex), spotted Mr. Carter and made his way over with a friendly smile. ‚ÄúHey, you must be the new teacher they‚Äôre interviewing.‚Äù
Mr. Carter nodded, slightly on edge. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, Mr. Carter. Nice to meet you.‚Äù
Paxton 7‚Äôs eyes flickered to the plain white shirt and tie Mr. Carter wore. ‚ÄúWe could really use someone like you on our team,‚Äù he said casually, his tone smooth. ‚ÄúMaybe after you settle in, we can get you fitted for a proper kit.‚Äù
Mr. Carter felt a chill run down his spine. He remembered Henry‚Äôs warning and forced a polite smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it.‚Äù
Paxton 7 smirked knowingly and walked away, leaving Mr. Carter standing there, unsettled by the encounter. The golden team‚Äôs influence was growing, and Mr. Carter was beginning to see what Henry had warned him about.
The days following Mr. Carter‚Äôs interview passed in a blur, but the unease Henry had planted in his mind remained. Every time he walked the halls of Crescent High, he couldn‚Äôt help but notice how the golden team seemed to be everywhere. The students wearing the shiny metallic golden AC Milan soccer kits moved in sync, their white button-up shirts and red-and-black ties peeking out from beneath the shimmering gold fabric. Their conversations were brief, their interactions eerily efficient, and yet there was a camaraderie about them that was hard to miss.
Mr. Carter‚Äôs appointment as the new math teacher was confirmed by the end of the week, and he returned to Crescent High to start his job. His classroom was in the west wing, where most of the academic classes took place, a safe distance from the gym and locker rooms where the golden team seemed to congregate. For a while, he hoped that his role as a math teacher would keep him out of their reach.
But on his second day, during lunch, Mr. Davis, the gym teacher who had already joined the golden team, paid him a visit.
"Mr. Carter," Davis greeted with a smile, wearing his golden AC Milan soccer kit proudly over his own white shirt and tie. "How‚Äôs the new job treating you?"
Mr. Carter glanced at Davis‚Äô outfit, feeling the now-familiar unease. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been good so far, just getting used to the students. Math doesn‚Äôt change much no matter where you teach.‚Äù
Davis nodded, but there was a strange gleam in his eye. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard good things. The students seem to like you. You‚Äôve got potential, you know. We‚Äôve been talking about bringing you in... officially.‚Äù
Carter raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúOfficially?‚Äù
Davis stepped closer, his voice dropping. ‚ÄúTo the golden team. You‚Äôve seen us around, I‚Äôm sure. We‚Äôre growing stronger every day, and we could use someone like you. You wouldn‚Äôt believe how much more focused and united we‚Äôve become since we joined.‚Äù
Carter felt the same chill he‚Äôd experienced when Paxton 7 approached him earlier in the week. ‚ÄúI appreciate the offer, Mr. Davis, but I‚Äôm fine as I am.‚Äù
Davis smiled, though his eyes remained intense. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really an offer, Mr. Carter. It‚Äôs just a matter of time. But don‚Äôt worry, when you‚Äôre ready, we‚Äôll have your kit waiting.‚Äù
With that, Davis turned and left, leaving Mr. Carter standing alone in the classroom, his mind swirling with unease. The golden team‚Äôs persistence was unsettling, but what worried him more was how inevitable it all felt. Every day, more students were seen wearing the golden kit. Even teachers like Davis had given in.
Henry‚Äôs words echoed in his mind: ‚ÄúIf anyone offers you a golden kit, don‚Äôt put it on.‚Äù
Later that afternoon, as Mr. Carter prepared for his final class of the day, he received an unexpected visitor‚ÄîHenry. He hadn‚Äôt seen the student since their conversation on his interview day, but something about Henry seemed different now. His clothes were a bit rumpled, and there was a tension in his posture, as if he was constantly looking over his shoulder.
‚ÄúHenry, good to see you again,‚Äù Mr. Carter greeted warmly. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt in my class this morning. Is everything alright?‚Äù
Henry stepped into the room, glancing toward the hallway to make sure they weren‚Äôt being watched. ‚ÄúI had to lay low for a bit. Things are getting worse. More students are giving in to the golden team, and they‚Äôre targeting teachers now.‚Äù
Carter nodded, his expression serious. ‚ÄúMr. Davis came by earlier. He wants me to join them.‚Äù
Henry‚Äôs eyes widened, and he stepped closer, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. Once you put on the golden kit, it‚Äôs over. You become one of them. They make it seem like a choice at first, but eventually, they‚Äôll force it on you. I‚Äôve seen it happen.‚Äù
Mr. Carter felt a shiver run down his spine. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, force it?‚Äù
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not waiting for people to join willingly anymore. Some students... they don‚Äôt have a choice. They‚Äôre cornering them in the locker rooms, or catching them after practice. They put the kit on them, and once it‚Äôs on, the transformation happens immediately. There‚Äôs no going back.‚Äù
Henry‚Äôs words hung in the air like a dark cloud. ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt anyone stopped this? The principal, the administration‚Äîsomeone must have noticed.‚Äù
Henry looked down, his voice shaking slightly. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in on it, too. It‚Äôs spreading. The golden team isn‚Äôt just students anymore. The principal‚Äôs office is empty half the time because they‚Äôre busy ‚Äòrecruiting.‚Äô‚Äù
Mr. Carter clenched his fists. He could feel the pressure closing in from all sides. ‚ÄúWhat are you planning to do?‚Äù
Henry hesitated for a moment, then leaned in closer. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a small group of us still resisting. We‚Äôve been meeting after school, trying to figure out how to stop them. But we‚Äôre running out of time. More students are getting turned every day. We need someone on the inside‚Äîsomeone they haven‚Äôt gotten to yet.‚Äù
Mr. Carter‚Äôs heart pounded as he realized what Henry was asking. ‚ÄúYou want me to join your group?‚Äù
Henry nodded. ‚ÄúWe need you, Mr. Carter. You‚Äôre new, and they haven‚Äôt got to you yet. But they will. The more people we have who are still free, the better chance we have at fighting back.‚Äù
For a moment, Mr. Carter considered his options. He hadn‚Äôt signed up for this when he took the job at Crescent High, but now it seemed like he had no choice. He couldn‚Äôt just stand by and watch as the students and teachers fell under the golden team‚Äôs control.
‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Mr. Carter said after a long pause. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in.‚Äù
Henry let out a breath he hadn‚Äôt realized he was holding. ‚ÄúGood. Meet us at the old baseball field after school. We‚Äôll explain everything.‚Äù
As Henry left the room, Mr. Carter stared at the door, feeling the weight of what he had just agreed to. He had no idea what he was walking into, but one thing was clear: the fight against the golden team was just beginning.
After school, Mr. Carter made his way to the old baseball field, a forgotten corner of the school grounds where Henry and the remaining resistors had gathered. The place had seen better days, overgrown with weeds and long neglected, much like the resistance itself‚Äîonce strong but now barely holding on.
Henry was there with a few others, including Jack, Tommy, and Ethan. Their faces were tense, their movements nervous. They had all seen too many friends fall under the sway of the golden team, and now it was just a matter of time before they were next.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad you came,‚Äù Henry said quietly as Mr. Carter approached. ‚ÄúWe need to act fast. Every day more of us disappear. We can‚Äôt just wait for them to come for us.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you have in mind?‚Äù Mr. Carter asked, his voice low but steady.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been trying to remove the kits from lockers,‚Äù Jack explained. ‚ÄúSneaking in after hours, cutting off their supply. But it‚Äôs not enough. Somehow, they‚Äôre always replaced by the next morning.‚Äù
Ethan spoke up. ‚ÄúWe need to find where they‚Äôre getting the kits. Someone‚Äôs supplying them, and it‚Äôs got to be from inside the school. If we can destroy the source, maybe we can stop this.‚Äù
Mr. Carter nodded. ‚ÄúDo you have any leads?‚Äù
Henry pulled out a map of the school. ‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs in the old storage area near the gym. It‚Äôs been locked up for years, but recently, we‚Äôve seen the golden team going in and out. We were planning on checking it out tomorrow night.‚Äù
‚ÄúTomorrow?‚Äù Mr. Carter frowned. ‚ÄúThat could be too late. They‚Äôve already approached me once. If they realize I‚Äôm resisting, they might move faster.‚Äù
Henry sighed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, but we need more time to prepare.‚Äù
Mr. Carter considered their options, the urgency weighing on him. ‚ÄúAlright. I‚Äôll go with you tomorrow night, but we can‚Äôt hesitate. We need to take action.‚Äù
As the group made their final plans, the tension was palpable. Time was running out, and Mr. Carter could feel the noose tightening around them all.
The following day, Mr. Carter went through his normal routine, but he couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was off. He noticed more students in the golden kits walking through the halls, their crisp white shirts and ties visible beneath the shimmering gold fabric. They moved with a quiet confidence, their eyes locking onto him every now and then, as if they knew something he didn‚Äôt.
By lunchtime, Mr. Carter‚Äôs unease reached its peak when Paxton 7 approached him again.
‚ÄúMr. Carter, I see you‚Äôre still resisting,‚Äù Paxton said with a smirk, standing a little too close for comfort. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôll come around soon enough. The golden kit is waiting for you.‚Äù
Carter forced a polite smile. ‚ÄúLike I said, I‚Äôm fine as I am.‚Äù
Paxton nodded slowly, his eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúYou say that now, but we all resist at first. It‚Äôs inevitable. The kit feels right when you put it on. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù
Paxton walked away, leaving Mr. Carter feeling more cornered than ever. He knew the golden team wasn‚Äôt going to wait much longer.
That night, Mr. Carter met with Henry and the others in the abandoned wing of the school, near the gym. They had planned their infiltration carefully. The old storage room, suspected to be the source of the golden kits, was locked, but they had managed to get a key from one of the few unconverted janitors still resisting.
The group moved silently through the darkened halls, their nerves on edge. As they approached the storage room, they noticed that the door was slightly ajar.
Henry froze. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù
Before anyone could react, they were ambushed. From the shadows, several members of the golden team appeared‚ÄîPaxton 7 leading the charge, with Mr. Davis and others flanking him. They wore their gleaming kits proudly, their white shirts and ties perfectly in place beneath the shimmering gold fabric.
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd let you get this far, did you?‚Äù Paxton said, his voice dripping with confidence.
Jack, Tommy, and Ethan tried to run, but Paxton‚Äôs team quickly cornered them. Mr. Davis grabbed Henry, holding him firmly as Paxton turned his attention to Mr. Carter.
‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve joined us when you had the chance,‚Äù Paxton said softly. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt worry, Mr. Carter. We‚Äôre going to take care of you.‚Äù
Paxton reached into the storage room and pulled out a fresh golden kit, neatly folded with a white button-up shirt and a red-and-black striped tie. He held it out to Mr. Carter, the golden fabric gleaming in the dim light.
For a moment, Mr. Carter hesitated. He had fought so hard to resist, but now, standing here with the golden kit in front of him, he could feel its pull. The fabric seemed to shimmer more intensely, as if it were calling to him, just like Henry had warned.
But Paxton‚Äôs words were soft, coaxing. ‚ÄúIt feels right when you put it on, Mr. Carter. Just try it. You‚Äôll understand.‚Äù
Mr. Carter‚Äôs resolve began to waver. The others had been subdued, their struggles futile against the golden team‚Äôs grip. The fabric seemed so soft, so inviting. Slowly, almost as if in a trance, he reached out and touched the kit.
The moment his fingers brushed the metallic gold, something shifted inside him. The tension, the fear‚Äîit all melted away. The shirt, the tie, the kit‚Äîeverything felt perfect as he took the folded clothes from Paxton.
Paxton‚Äôs smile widened. ‚ÄúGo ahead, Mr. Carter. Put it on.‚Äù
Without a word, Mr. Carter removed his suit jacket and began to dress. He slipped on the white button-up shirt, tied the red-and-black tie around his neck, and finally pulled the golden AC Milan soccer kit over his shoulders. It fit perfectly, molding to his body like it had been made for him.
As he adjusted the shirt and tie beneath the golden kit, a sense of calm and power washed over him. His mind, once filled with resistance, now felt clear, focused. He was part of something bigger now.
Paxton stepped back, admiring the transformation. ‚ÄúWelcome to the team, Mr. Carter.‚Äù
Mr. Carter smiled, feeling the strength of the golden kit coursing through him. It was right. It was inevitable. And now, he was one of them.
As Mr. Carter finished slipping on the golden kit, Paxton 7 stepped forward again, this time holding a pair of shiny golden headphones. The moment Mr. Carter‚Äôs eyes landed on them, he felt another deep, irresistible pull. The golden kit had already started changing him‚Äîhe could feel his thoughts slowing, his focus narrowing‚Äîbut these headphones seemed like the final step.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre almost there, Mr. Carter,‚Äù Paxton 7 said with a smirk. ‚ÄúJust one more piece, and you‚Äôll be fully part of the team.‚Äù
Mr. Carter barely resisted as Paxton placed the golden headphones over his ears. The moment they clicked into place, his mind was bombarded with soft whispers‚Äîbarely perceptible at first but growing louder with each passing second. Obey. Join the team. Serve. You belong here. The words were layered under a pulsing beat, their rhythm syncing with his heartbeat, growing more insistent.
Suddenly, a new wave of laughter bubbled up in Mr. Carter‚Äôs throat. It wasn‚Äôt his usual laugh‚Äîit was louder, more uncontrolled, almost stupid. He tried to stifle it, but the headphones drowned out any remaining resistance. He was laughing, but not at anything in particular. The more he laughed, the more his thoughts faded, replaced by an overwhelming desire to belong to the golden team.
As the subliminal messages continued, Mr. Carter‚Äôs posture shifted. His once-formal, thoughtful demeanor dissolved into something more carefree, almost carefree to the point of recklessness. His shoulders slouched, his grin widened, and his eyes took on the same glazed look that the rest of the golden team wore.
Paxton 7, noticing the shift, grinned and leaned in. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name now, bro?‚Äù
Mr. Carter blinked, struggling to remember. But before he could answer, the answer came from somewhere deep inside him, pushed to the surface by the golden whispers in his ears.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm... Coby,‚Äù he said, his voice now slower and simpler. ‚ÄúYeah, Coby! Bro, this feels... awesome!‚Äù
Paxton laughed and clapped him on the shoulder. ‚ÄúWelcome to the team, Coby 11.‚Äù
Coby ‚Äî formerly Mr. Carter ‚Äî laughed again, a deep, dumb chuckle that echoed in the empty storage room. His mind, once sharp and filled with hesitation, now buzzed with nothing but loyalty to the golden team and the thrill of being part of something bigger. He barely noticed when Paxton handed him a new set of instructions through the headphones, the subliminal messages seeping deeper into his mind. Recruit others. Spread the team. Serve Captain Gold.
Coby nodded absently, laughing once more. ‚ÄúYeah, bro, I‚Äôm gonna help get more dudes! This is so... awesome!‚Äù
The transformation was complete. Coby 11 was no longer the smart, thoughtful teacher Mr. Carter had been. He was part of the golden team now, just another recruit wearing the shining golden kit over his white shirt and red-and-black tie, his mind buzzing with loyalty and a singular purpose.
Paxton 7, satisfied with the transformation, turned back to the others in the room. Jack, Tommy, and Ethan were still struggling, but it was clear that they couldn‚Äôt hold out for much longer.
‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôve got a few more recruits to add to the team,‚Äù Paxton said with a wicked grin. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get them their kits.‚Äù
The schoolboard was very happy everyone complied in the end...here are the new Golden students.
And here are the new Golden teachers...

### Crescent High - Part 1
It had been a month since Crescent High saw the arrival of the new headmaster, Mr. Golding. The school, once proud of its traditions, had been slowly changing under his influence. The blue-and-white uniforms were being replaced, and baseball, the heart of the school‚Äôs sports culture, was fading.
One by one, students were called into Mr. Golding‚Äôs office. When they returned, they were different‚Äîdressed in shiny metallic golden AC Milan soccer kits over white button-up shirts and black-and-red striped ties. What was more alarming was that these students weren‚Äôt just changing their uniforms‚Äîthey were changing their names. Nerdy names like Jonathan became Chase, and quiet Daniel became Blake. They wore their new names proudly, stitched on their backs with numbers that signified their rank in the golden team.
Ryan, once Jake‚Äôs friend and the star pitcher of the baseball team, was the first to fall.
Ryan had been summoned to Mr. Golding‚Äôs office one afternoon. He wasn‚Äôt too worried at first‚Äîafter all, he had been the golden boy of the baseball team. But when he stepped into the office, his life changed forever.
Inside, Mr. Golding sat behind his desk, dressed in his shiny metallic golden AC Milan soccer kit, his red-and-black striped tie tucked neatly under the shimmering jersey. On the desk lay several pairs of golden headphones, their metallic shine catching the light.
‚ÄúCome in, Ryan,‚Äù Mr. Golding said smoothly, gesturing to the chair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been expecting you.‚Äù
Ryan took a seat, eyeing the golden headphones. He had heard rumors about them but hadn‚Äôt believed they could change someone so dramatically. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? Why‚Äôs everyone wearing those kits?‚Äù
Mr. Golding smiled knowingly, picking up a pair of the headphones. ‚ÄúThis is the future, Ryan. The golden team represents strength, unity, and power. You belong with us.‚Äù
Before Ryan could object, the golden headphones were placed over his ears. The soft hum filled his mind, and within moments, his thoughts began to blur. The hypnotic voice inside the headphones whispered instructions.
‚ÄúYou are no longer Ryan. You will be known as Brandon 9. You will obey. You will be part of the golden team.‚Äù
Ryan‚Äôs body relaxed as the name Brandon 9 settled into his mind. The nerdy name ‚ÄúRyan‚Äù felt distant, as if it no longer belonged to him. His muscles relaxed, and a new sense of purpose filled him.
Mr. Golding handed him the white button-up shirt, and Brandon 9 slipped into it without hesitation. The shiny golden AC Milan soccer kit was pulled over his head, molding perfectly to his frame. Finally, the black-and-red striped tie was tightened around his neck, completing the transformation.
The once laid-back Ryan was gone. In his place stood Brandon 9, confident and proud.
Jake had noticed the change in Ryan‚Äînow Brandon 9‚Äîimmediately. His friend was no longer the same person. Ryan, the goofy guy who loved baseball, had become someone else‚Äîserious, focused, and completely devoted to the golden team. Jake had tried to confront Brandon about it, but every time he spoke to him, Brandon 9 simply smiled, saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand soon, bro.‚Äù
The pressure on Jake was building. He knew it was only a matter of time before they came for him. One day, it happened. Jake was working out in the gym when his clothes disappeared. Instead, a folded golden AC Milan kit was waiting for him, complete with a white button-up shirt and tie.
Before he could leave, Brandon 9 and James 11‚Äîanother of his old friends, who had once been known as Derek‚Äîappeared, blocking the exit.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time, Jake,‚Äù Brandon said, his voice calm. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to join the team.‚Äù
Jake backed away, his heart pounding. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not putting that on.‚Äù
But before he could escape, the golden team members grabbed him, forcing him to sit on the bench. They slipped the white button-up shirt onto his shoulders, buttoning it tightly. Next came the golden AC Milan soccer kit, gleaming under the fluorescent lights. Finally, they tied the black-and-red striped tie around his neck.
As the golden kit molded to his body, Jake felt his thoughts shifting. His resistance was fading, and a new name began to settle in his mind.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no longer Jake,‚Äù Brandon 9 said with a smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Paxton 7 now.‚Äù
Paxton 7 nodded slowly, the name feeling right. The old Jake was gone. He was now part of the golden team, just like the others.
Not all students joined willingly. Some, like Lukas Belccome, tried to fight back. Lukas had always been quiet, a little nerdy, and had managed to avoid the golden team‚Äôs influence for weeks. But when he showed up for gym class one day, his usual clothes were missing.
In their place was a golden AC Milan kit, waiting for him.
Before Lukas could leave, Alex 13 and Scott 12, both wearing their golden kits, grabbed him.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre joining, Lukas,‚Äù Alex said, his tone firm. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run anymore.‚Äù
Lukas struggled, but the golden team members were too strong. They forced him to sit on the bench, starting the ritual. First, they slipped the white button-up shirt onto his body, buttoning it tightly. Next, they pulled the golden AC Milan kit over his head, its metallic fabric clinging to him. Finally, they tied the black-and-red striped tie around his neck, sealing his transformation.
As the golden kit molded to Lukas‚Äôs body, his thoughts began to shift. His nerdy name felt wrong, and a new identity began to form.
‚ÄúFrom now on,‚Äù Scott said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be known as Brody 13.‚Äù
Lukas‚Äînow Brody 13‚Äîstood up, his old personality erased. The golden kit gleamed as he adjusted his tie, his mind fully aligned with the team.
Other students, like Nathan, were lured into traps. Nathan had been studying in the library, hoping to avoid the golden team‚Äôs influence. But he wasn‚Äôt safe.
While he was working, Blake 15 and Connor 10‚Äîboth fully transformed‚Äîcornered him. Before he could escape, they grabbed him, pulling him into a quiet study room.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not getting away, Nathan,‚Äù Blake said with a grin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to join.‚Äù
Nathan struggled, but it was no use. The golden team members forced him to change. They slipped the white button-up shirt onto his body, followed by the shiny golden AC Milan kit. Finally, the black-and-red striped tie was tied around his neck.
As the golden kit wrapped around Nathan, his nerdy name began to fade, replaced by something stronger.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not Nathan anymore,‚Äù Blake said, tightening the tie. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Troy 21.‚Äù
Troy 21 stood up, his old self forgotten. He was now a proud member of the golden team, ready to serve.
The next week
It was a typical afternoon at Crescent High, and the gym was filled with the usual sounds of students practicing and warming up for their respective sports. The blue-and-white uniforms still dominated the space, though whispers of the golden team‚Äôs rise were hard to ignore.
The coach stood in the center of the gym, blowing his whistle to get everyone‚Äôs attention. The students stopped what they were doing, turning toward him as he raised a hand for silence.
‚ÄúListen up!‚Äù Coach barked, his voice echoing through the large gym. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a change. From now on, every student must wear the golden AC Milan kit. No exceptions.‚Äù
The gym fell silent, a wave of confusion and unease rippling through the crowd. Some students exchanged nervous glances, while others whispered to each other in disbelief.
Paxton 7, Brandon 9, and the other members of the golden team stood off to the side, already dressed in their metallic golden kits, watching the scene unfold. Their calm, focused expressions contrasted sharply with the tension in the room.
One of the students, Nathan, took a step forward, his face pale. ‚ÄúBut... why? We‚Äôve always worn the blue-and-white uniforms.‚Äù
Coach‚Äôs eyes narrowed, and his voice grew firmer. ‚ÄúThe golden kit is the new standard. You will all wear it, starting today. Anyone who refuses will be dealt with.‚Äù
As Coach made the announcement, several students felt panic rising within them. They had heard the rumors about the golden team‚Äîhow wearing the kit changed you, how it turned you into someone else. Some of them had seen it happen with their own friends.
Two students, Jake and Daniel, shared a look of understanding. They weren‚Äôt going to stick around to see what happened next.
‚ÄúWe need to get out of here,‚Äù Jake whispered urgently. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù
Without waiting for a response, they bolted from the gym, heading straight for the locker rooms. But they weren‚Äôt the only ones. Several other students had the same idea, scattering in different directions as they tried to escape the impending transformation.
Coach, seeing the chaos unfold, blew his whistle again. ‚ÄúWhere do you think you‚Äôre going?‚Äù he shouted, but his voice was drowned out by the sound of students fleeing.
Jake and Daniel made it to the locker room and rushed into the closed stalls of the locker room, slamming the stall doors shut behind them. Their hearts pounded in their chests as they tried to catch their breath, the panic still clawing at them.
‚ÄúWe just need to wait it out,‚Äù Daniel muttered. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt make us wear the kits if we don‚Äôt come out.‚Äù
But Coach wasn‚Äôt about to let them off so easily. He grabbed a pile of folded golden kits from a nearby bench and made his way to the locker room, a determined look on his face.
As Jake and Daniel sat in the stalls, they heard the sound of footsteps approaching. Their stomachs churned with anxiety. Suddenly, the door to the locker room swung open, and Coach‚Äôs voice echoed through the space.
‚ÄúYou think you can hide from this?‚Äù Coach called out, his tone dripping with authority. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no escaping the golden team.‚Äù
Before either of them could react, golden jerseys were tossed over the stall doors. The metallic fabric fell over them, draping across their shoulders. The moment the jerseys touched their skin, the smell hit them.
It was overwhelming.
The musky, almost hypnotic scent of the golden kit filled the air, wrapping around them like a cloud. Jake and Daniel‚Äôs first instinct was to push the jerseys away, but the smell was intoxicating. It filled their senses, dulling their minds and relaxing their bodies.
Jake‚Äôs breathing slowed, his hands trembling as he clutched the golden kit. ‚ÄúI... I can‚Äôt think...‚Äù he muttered, his voice barely audible.
Daniel‚Äôs face had gone slack, his eyes half-closed as the smell continued to overwhelm him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... it‚Äôs so strong,‚Äù he whispered, his voice distant.
The more they breathed in the scent, the more their resistance crumbled. Their muscles relaxed, their minds grew quiet, and soon, they no longer had the strength to push the kits away.
Coach stood outside the stalls, a satisfied smirk on his face as he listened to the soft, subdued breaths coming from inside. He knew the golden kits had already begun their work.
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt fight it,‚Äù Coach said calmly. ‚ÄúThe smell of the golden kit is all you need to accept your new role. Just let it happen.‚Äù
Inside the stalls, Jake and Daniel slowly stood up, their movements sluggish but deliberate. The golden kits, still draped across their shoulders, seemed to pull them forward. Without fully realizing what they were doing, they began to dress.
First came the white button-up shirts, which they slipped into mechanically, their hands moving as if under someone else‚Äôs control. The fabric clung to their bodies, fitting snugly against their skin.
Next, they pulled the golden AC Milan soccer kits over their heads. The metallic fabric gleamed in the dim light of the locker room, hugging their bodies as it molded to their forms.
Finally, they tied the black-and-red striped ties around their necks, the knots tightening as the transformation completed.
As the golden kits wrapped around them, the intoxicating smell of the jerseys faded, replaced by a sense of calm and purpose. Their minds, once filled with panic, were now clear and focused. Blue was forgotten forever.
Jake‚Äînow Parker 18‚Äîadjusted his tie, a small smile forming on his lips as his new identity settled into place. He felt stronger, more confident, as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
Daniel‚Äînow Bryce 19‚Äîstood beside him, his posture tall and proud. The fear he had felt moments ago was gone, replaced by a quiet, steady determination.
Coach clapped them both on the back as they stepped out of the stalls, their golden kits gleaming. ‚ÄúWelcome to the team, Parker 18 and Bryce 19. You‚Äôre going to make us proud.‚Äù
Parker 18 and Bryce 19 nodded in unison, their old selves forgotten. They were part of the golden team now, and nothing could stop them.
Now they kneel in front of their new bros.
Would you join them willingly, or would you run like Daniel.... or should I say Bryce?

### Crescent Park
A special thanks to all my bros on the team!
As the sun dipped lower behind the trees of Crescent Park, a tense stillness filled the air. The Golden Team moved with precision, converting park-goers one by one, their sleek metallic jerseys glinting in the fading light. Coach Richard oversaw the operation, his towering frame exuding authority, while Walter‚Äîrecently promoted to team manager‚Äîmoved with newfound confidence, handling the transformations with growing expertise.
Walter approached his next target, a young man sitting alone near a pond, fiddling with his phone. His heart beat faster, not out of fear or hesitation, but from anticipation. He relished this. As the team manager, he took pride in outfitting the recruits, creating custom golden suits that symbolized their complete submission. He had worked hard to design each uniform, from the sharp white button-up shirts to the black-and-red striped ties beneath the shimmering golden jerseys. Now, it was time to add another name to the roster.
‚ÄúHey, man, mind if I sit?‚Äù Walter‚Äôs voice was smoother now, confident. The young man glanced up, surprised, but nodded.
Walter slipped a golden jersey from his bag, his fingers brushing against the soft, shimmering fabric. ‚ÄúYou ever worn something like this? Trust me‚Äîit feels incredible. Changes everything.‚Äù
The young man raised an eyebrow, clearly unsure of where this was going, but before he could react, Walter grabbed his shoulder, locking him in place. The golden jersey slid over his head with an eerie precision, and as the fabric touched his skin, the transformation began.
The first sensation was warmth‚Äîan almost intoxicating comfort that spread from the jersey, radiating into every fiber of his being. The young man gasped, his body stiffening, his mind fighting for control, but it was futile. The warmth grew more intense, like being wrapped in the most welcoming embrace. His muscles slackened, a strange euphoria taking over as his thoughts slowed, rearranged, and reshaped by the power of the jersey.
As the golden spirals in his mind deepened, his name‚Äîwhatever it had been before‚Äîwas erased. He blinked, and a new name filled the void in his mind: Dean. It wasn‚Äôt just a name; it was an identity, a purpose. Dean belonged to the Golden Team now. His personality shifted, becoming simpler, more focused, his mind locked on one thing‚Äîobeying the Cap, obeying the Gold.
‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold,‚Äù Dean murmured softly, as if the mantra had always been part of him.
Walter grinned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, bro. You‚Äôre one of us now.‚Äù
Dean‚Äôs posture straightened, his hands smoothing over his new jersey. His speech changed, becoming more casual, almost bro-like. ‚ÄúFeels good, man. So good to just‚Ä¶ obey.‚Äù
Walter clapped him on the back. ‚ÄúWelcome to the team, Dean. Now let‚Äôs get you to work.‚Äù
Not far off, Brody and Scott were working on another group of men, this time two joggers who had been cornered by the fountain. Brody, with his sharp eyes and quick movements, had already wrestled a VR headset onto one of the men. The spirals flickered to life, and the jogger's body jerked in response, his eyes wide with shock as his mind was engulfed in the golden waves of hypnotic control.
Brody and Scott are ready to recruit some more bros..
The man‚Äôs breathing quickened as the headset took over, each pulse of the golden spirals draining his resistance. His body sagged into submission, his mind softening like putty, molding itself to fit the team‚Äôs desires. His name? Gone. A new one settled in its place‚ÄîBarry
Barry let out a soft laugh, his former self melting away. He tugged at the golden jersey that now fit snugly over his chest, feeling an overwhelming sense of belonging. His voice, once steady and confident, now carried a playful, bro-ish tone. ‚ÄúMan, why didn‚Äôt I do this sooner? Feels so right, bro.‚Äù
Scott stepped up beside him, laughing with him, slinging an arm around his shoulder. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about, Barry. You‚Äôre gonna love being on the team. We‚Äôre all about the Gold now.‚Äù
Barry‚Äôs face lit up as he joined in the laughter, his eyes swirling with the lingering golden spirals. His focus had narrowed, his thoughts reshaped into one core belief: obedience to Cap and Gold. ‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold,‚Äù he repeated, his voice filled with a mix of pride and devotion.
As more men succumbed, Walter‚Äôs confidence only grew. He was proud of what the team was becoming, of the role he played in crafting their identities and uniforms. Each golden suit, carefully tailored and fitted, was a symbol of their unity, their purpose. The fabric seemed to glow brighter as each new recruit joined, as if absorbing the strength of their allegiance.
Walter spotted another target, a tall, lean man who had been watching the chaos unfold from the far end of the park. The man‚Äôs eyes were wide with fear as he turned to run, but Walter was faster. He reached him in seconds, grabbing him by the arm and yanking him back toward the team. The man struggled, panic in his eyes, but Walter was calm, collected.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to fight this, take my headset‚Äù Walter said, slipping the golden VR headset over the man‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúJust let it happen.‚Äù
The man‚Äôs body trembled as the spirals began their work, dissolving the fear, the resistance, until he was completely still, his mind under the control of the Golden Team. His name was stripped away, replaced with something new‚ÄîTravis. His thoughts dulled, his emotions drained, replaced with a singular focus: obedience.
‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold,‚Äù Travis whispered, his voice trembling with newfound loyalty. Walter gave Travis his new uniform and he discarded his bright blue one. He obeys Cap.
Coach Richard watched from a distance, his gaze approving. Walter had come far, and he had proven himself not just as a manager but as an integral part of the team. He made sure every recruit wore their uniform with pride, and he executed the transformations with precision and confidence.
As the park darkened and the last of the stragglers were brought into the fold, Walter, Brody, and Scott stood proudly beside Coach Richard. The Golden Team had grown once again, and with each new recruit, their power expanded.
‚ÄúAnother good day‚Äôs work,‚Äù Coach Richard said, his voice filled with pride. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll keep pushing, keep growing. They all obey us eventually.‚Äù
Walter nodded, a satisfied smile on his face. ‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold.‚Äù
The others echoed the mantra, their voices blending into a single, unified chant. The park was theirs, and soon, there would be more parks, more recruits, more gold.
At the other side of the park...
I was in the middle of a perfect slapshot, the whistling through the air, when I saw them coming‚Äîthese guys in golden jerseys. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first. It‚Äôs a park, right? People wear weird stuff all the time. But there was something off about the way they moved. They weren‚Äôt just walking‚Äîthey were converging, fast, in this synchronized, almost military formation.
Then I saw them close in on the basketball game happening across the field. My buddies were laughing and shouting, passing the ball back and forth, completely oblivious to the group of golden-shirted guys surrounding them. My heart jumped, something about the way they moved didn‚Äôt sit right.
Before I could shout a warning, one of the golden guys‚Äîthis huge dude with a smirk‚Äîgrabbed Tim, our goalie. He yanked a shiny gold jersey over Tim's head. It was so quick, almost casual, but the moment that jersey touched him, Tim froze, his whole body locking up like he‚Äôd been hit by a truck. He dropped the ball, eyes wide, and I could see the struggle on his face, like he was trying to fight whatever was happening. But it didn‚Äôt last long. His muscles relaxed, and then, something worse‚Äîhis face twisted into this... this grin, like he was happy, relieved even.
‚ÄúTim! Run!‚Äù I shouted, but it was too late.
The golden guy holding him turned him around so we could all see. Tim‚Äôs back was now emblazoned with a name I didn‚Äôt recognize‚Äî‚ÄúBrad 8.‚Äù I froze in place, stick in hand. That wasn‚Äôt Tim anymore. Brad, whoever that was, nodded, still grinning, and joined the golden guys, completely in sync.
I felt a pit in my stomach. Panic set in as I watched them move to the next one‚ÄîMark. Mark was trying to shove the guys off, but another jersey was already over his head. The moment it touched him, his resistance melted away. His body slumped before straightening into that same eerily obedient posture. He turned around, and sure enough, ‚ÄúBarry 17‚Äù was stitched across his back. Just like that, he was gone too.
That‚Äôs when instinct took over. I dropped my ball and bolted for the trees. I ran so fast I could feel the air burn my lungs, but I didn‚Äôt stop. Not until I was deep into the park‚Äôs wooded area, out of sight. My heart was pounding, and my hands shook as I crouched behind a thick bush, peeking out just enough to watch.
From my hiding spot, I had a clear view of the field. I could still see the others‚Äîthe guys I‚Äôd known for years‚Äîbeing systematically transformed. One by one, those golden jerseys were yanked over their heads, and each time it was the same. First, a struggle, but then... they‚Äôd just stop. Stop fighting, stop thinking, and become part of them. Every time, a new name appeared on their backs‚ÄîHenry, Brock, Chad‚Äîand with it, the person I knew was gone.
The golden guys were chanting something too. I could barely make it out over the wind and rustling trees, but it sounded like, ‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold.‚Äù Over and over again, as if that was the only thing that mattered now.
I saw one of the golden guys grab Alex, the last one left. Alex was a tough dude, always talking about how he‚Äôd never back down from a fight. But he didn‚Äôt stand a chance. They wrestled him to the ground, and soon, he was wearing the same jersey. When he stood up, his back was turned toward me. ‚ÄúCody 23‚Äù was stitched into the gold, as if he‚Äôd never been Alex at all.
I pressed myself harder into the ground, biting back the urge to scream or run again. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing. It was like they weren‚Äôt even human anymore. They laughed, patted each other on the back, but it wasn‚Äôt normal. It was like... like they were all sharing the same brain, like they all belonged to something much bigger than themselves.
I swallowed, my mouth dry. I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt breathe, because if they found me, I knew what would happen. I‚Äôd get a jersey too, and that would be the end of me.
The golden guys, now with my friends‚Äîno, with Brad, Barry, and Cody‚Äîmoved on, searching for more people in the park. They‚Äôd completely forgotten about the game, about the goals and the ball. That wasn‚Äôt their world anymore. It was all about Cap and Gold. That was their new identity, and I was the last one left who wasn‚Äôt part of it.
I stayed there, hidden in the bushes, for what felt like hours. The chanting faded as they moved farther away, leaving me alone in the park that used to be ours. I had to get out of here, but every time I thought about leaving, I remembered the look on Tim‚Äôs‚Äîno, Brad‚Äôs‚Äîface when they took him. That empty, happy grin. I was terrified I‚Äôd see that smile in the reflection of my own face if they caught me.
I waited until the sun began to set before creeping out of my hiding spot, moving quietly through the trees, making sure no one could see me. But as I left, the mantra kept echoing in my head, the same phrase over and over:
‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold.‚Äù
It wouldn‚Äôt stop. And a part of me feared that no matter how far I ran, I might still hear it.
1 hour later..
I crept through the trees, my heart still hammering in my chest. The sun was dipping lower, casting long shadows over the park. I thought I was in the clear, that I could escape unnoticed. But as I took a step out of the wooded area, there was a sudden rustling behind me.
"Where you headed, bro?"
The voice sent ice down my spine. I turned, and there he was‚ÄîBrody, one of the golden guys. He was standing just a few feet away, his metallic golden jersey gleaming in the fading light, the white button-up shirt and striped tie underneath still visible. He wore that same grin I had seen on the others, like he was in on some cosmic joke.
I froze, my legs refusing to move, my mouth dry. I had no idea how he had found me, but I could see it in his eyes‚Äîhe knew. I was the last one left. Brody took a step forward, his grin widening, and before I could react, two more golden-clad guys appeared from the trees‚ÄîScott and Dean. They had circled me.
‚ÄúCoach is gonna be happy to see you,‚Äù Brody said, his voice so casual, like we were just old friends hanging out. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run from this, man. You‚Äôre part of the team now.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, I‚ÄîI‚Äôm not,‚Äù I stammered, taking a shaky step back. My hands were trembling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like you.‚Äù
Scott chuckled softly. ‚ÄúYou will be.‚Äù
Before I could even think to bolt, Dean moved with lightning speed, grabbing me by the arms. His grip was firm, but not painful. It was almost... comforting. "Don't fight it, bro," he whispered, his voice strangely soothing. "We obey Cap and we obey Gold."
‚ÄúNo! Let me go!‚Äù I yelled, struggling to break free, but Dean held me tight. Brody and Scott stepped forward, both of them pulling a golden jersey from the bag slung over Brody‚Äôs shoulder. My heart pounded in my chest as I realized what was coming.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù Brody said, ‚Äúit feels good once it‚Äôs on.‚Äù
I thrashed, trying to escape, but Dean‚Äôs grip was like iron. I couldn‚Äôt break free. Then, with a swift motion, Scott yanked the jersey over my head. As the golden fabric touched my skin, something inside me shifted‚Äîan overwhelming warmth spread through my body, starting from where the jersey pressed against my shoulders, down my arms, into my chest. My resistance faltered, my limbs growing heavy.
The warmth was intoxicating. It seeped into my bones, making my mind feel... fuzzy. My thoughts, once sharp and panicked, began to blur at the edges. I could still feel the fear, but it was fading, being replaced by something else‚Äîsomething far more pleasant. A sense of belonging, of calm.
My legs buckled, and I fell to my knees. Brody and Scott knelt beside me, their hands resting on my shoulders. ‚ÄúJust let it happen,‚Äù Scott whispered, ‚Äúit‚Äôs easier that way.‚Äù
I tried to hold onto who I was‚Äîtried to remember my name, my life‚Äîbut the jersey was working its way deeper into my mind. I could feel it now, creeping through my thoughts, replacing them with something new. My name‚Äîit felt distant, like a word I had heard once but didn‚Äôt fully recognize anymore. A new name was forming in its place.
As I knelt there, struggling against the warmth flooding my body from the golden jersey, the last fragments of my old self slipped away. My name‚Ä¶ I tried to hold onto it, to remember who I was before all this. But the more I fought, the deeper the warmth sank in, washing away my resistance. A new name began to form, one that felt foreign and familiar all at once.
‚ÄúJoshua,‚Äù I whispered, the word coming from somewhere deep within me. It felt right, like it had always been my name, like it was who I was meant to be.
Brody smiled down at me, nodding approvingly. ‚ÄúYeah, Joshua. Welcome to the team, bro.‚Äù
I felt a strange rush of pride. The jersey was no longer just a piece of fabric clinging to my body‚Äîit was part of me now. It fit perfectly, like it had been made for me, like it belonged on me. And I belonged to the team.
Scott stood beside me, placing a firm hand on my shoulder, his grip no longer threatening but reassuring. ‚ÄúYou feel it now, right, Joshua? The purpose. The brotherhood.‚Äù
I nodded, standing up on shaky legs. The transformation had washed away every trace of fear and hesitation, replacing them with something far stronger. I looked at the other guys, at Dean, Scott, and Brody, and I didn‚Äôt just see a group of men‚ÄîI saw my team, my brothers. I was one of them now.
I turned to look at my reflection in the fountain. The name "Joshua 19" was emblazoned on the back of my golden jersey, the number gleaming in the evening light. It felt perfect. I felt perfect.
My thoughts had shifted completely. The confusion, the doubt‚Äîall gone. Now, there was only loyalty. Loyalty to Cap. Loyalty to Gold. It was simple, clear, and it filled me with a sense of fulfillment I had never known before.
Brody chuckled, his voice warm as he patted me on the back. ‚ÄúYou get it now, Joshua. We obey Cap and we obey Gold.‚Äù
The words slipped from my lips as if they had always been there. ‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold,‚Äù I echoed, feeling the power of the mantra take root deep within me. It wasn‚Äôt just a phrase; it was a way of life. A belief. An oath.
Scott and Dean joined in, all of us chanting together, a unified voice of devotion. ‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold.‚Äù
I smiled, finally feeling at peace. The struggle was over. I wasn‚Äôt running anymore. I wasn‚Äôt hiding. I was home.
As I stood there with my brothers, the mission was clear. We weren‚Äôt done yet. The park was full of new recruits, and I knew exactly what my role was now. It was time to find them, welcome them, and show them what it meant to be part of the team. I was Joshua now, and nothing else mattered.
They were told to enter a golden bus and drive of to the Golden Home where all the Golden Team boys live. They needed to wear the VR headsets, because no one knows where it is...yet everyone obeyed.
I had a purpose, and together with the Golden Team, we were going to make sure everyone understood: we obey Cap, and we obey Gold.

### Changes: Crescent Park
A special thanks to all my bros on the team!
As the sun dipped lower behind the trees of Crescent Park, a tense stillness filled the air. The Golden Team moved with precision, converting park-goers one by one, their sleek metallic jerseys glinting in the fading light. Coach Richard oversaw the operation, his towering frame exuding authority, while Walter‚Äîrecently promoted to team manager‚Äîmoved with newfound confidence, handling the transformations with growing expertise.
Walter approached his next target, a young man sitting alone near a pond, fiddling with his phone. His heart beat faster, not out of fear or hesitation, but from anticipation. He relished this. As the team manager, he took pride in outfitting the recruits, creating custom golden suits that symbolized their complete submission. He had worked hard to design each uniform, from the sharp white button-up shirts to the black-and-red striped ties beneath the shimmering golden jerseys. Now, it was time to add another name to the roster.
‚ÄúHey, man, mind if I sit?‚Äù Walter‚Äôs voice was smoother now, confident. The young man glanced up, surprised, but nodded.
Walter slipped a golden jersey from his bag, his fingers brushing against the soft, shimmering fabric. ‚ÄúYou ever worn something like this? Trust me‚Äîit feels incredible. Changes everything.‚Äù
The young man raised an eyebrow, clearly unsure of where this was going, but before he could react, Walter grabbed his shoulder, locking him in place. The golden jersey slid over his head with an eerie precision, and as the fabric touched his skin, the transformation began.
The first sensation was warmth‚Äîan almost intoxicating comfort that spread from the jersey, radiating into every fiber of his being. The young man gasped, his body stiffening, his mind fighting for control, but it was futile. The warmth grew more intense, like being wrapped in the most welcoming embrace. His muscles slackened, a strange euphoria taking over as his thoughts slowed, rearranged, and reshaped by the power of the jersey.
As the golden spirals in his mind deepened, his name‚Äîwhatever it had been before‚Äîwas erased. He blinked, and a new name filled the void in his mind: Dean. It wasn‚Äôt just a name; it was an identity, a purpose. Dean belonged to the Golden Team now. His personality shifted, becoming simpler, more focused, his mind locked on one thing‚Äîobeying the Cap, obeying the Gold.
‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold,‚Äù Dean murmured softly, as if the mantra had always been part of him.
Walter grinned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, bro. You‚Äôre one of us now.‚Äù
Dean‚Äôs posture straightened, his hands smoothing over his new jersey. His speech changed, becoming more casual, almost bro-like. ‚ÄúFeels good, man. So good to just‚Ä¶ obey.‚Äù
Walter clapped him on the back. ‚ÄúWelcome to the team, Dean. Now let‚Äôs get you to work.‚Äù
Not far off, Brody and Scott were working on another group of men, this time two joggers who had been cornered by the fountain. Brody, with his sharp eyes and quick movements, had already wrestled a VR headset onto one of the men. The spirals flickered to life, and the jogger's body jerked in response, his eyes wide with shock as his mind was engulfed in the golden waves of hypnotic control.
Brody and Scott are ready to recruit some more bros..
The man‚Äôs breathing quickened as the headset took over, each pulse of the golden spirals draining his resistance. His body sagged into submission, his mind softening like putty, molding itself to fit the team‚Äôs desires. His name? Gone. A new one settled in its place‚ÄîBarry
Barry let out a soft laugh, his former self melting away. He tugged at the golden jersey that now fit snugly over his chest, feeling an overwhelming sense of belonging. His voice, once steady and confident, now carried a playful, bro-ish tone. ‚ÄúMan, why didn‚Äôt I do this sooner? Feels so right, bro.‚Äù
Scott stepped up beside him, laughing with him, slinging an arm around his shoulder. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about, Barry. You‚Äôre gonna love being on the team. We‚Äôre all about the Gold now.‚Äù
Barry‚Äôs face lit up as he joined in the laughter, his eyes swirling with the lingering golden spirals. His focus had narrowed, his thoughts reshaped into one core belief: obedience to Cap and Gold. ‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold,‚Äù he repeated, his voice filled with a mix of pride and devotion.
As more men succumbed, Walter‚Äôs confidence only grew. He was proud of what the team was becoming, of the role he played in crafting their identities and uniforms. Each golden suit, carefully tailored and fitted, was a symbol of their unity, their purpose. The fabric seemed to glow brighter as each new recruit joined, as if absorbing the strength of their allegiance.
Walter spotted another target, a tall, lean man who had been watching the chaos unfold from the far end of the park. The man‚Äôs eyes were wide with fear as he turned to run, but Walter was faster. He reached him in seconds, grabbing him by the arm and yanking him back toward the team. The man struggled, panic in his eyes, but Walter was calm, collected.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to fight this, take my headset‚Äù Walter said, slipping the golden VR headset over the man‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúJust let it happen.‚Äù
The man‚Äôs body trembled as the spirals began their work, dissolving the fear, the resistance, until he was completely still, his mind under the control of the Golden Team. His name was stripped away, replaced with something new‚ÄîTravis. His thoughts dulled, his emotions drained, replaced with a singular focus: obedience.
‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold,‚Äù Travis whispered, his voice trembling with newfound loyalty. Walter gave Travis his new uniform and he discarded his bright blue one. He obeys Cap.
Coach Richard watched from a distance, his gaze approving. Walter had come far, and he had proven himself not just as a manager but as an integral part of the team. He made sure every recruit wore their uniform with pride, and he executed the transformations with precision and confidence.
As the park darkened and the last of the stragglers were brought into the fold, Walter, Brody, and Scott stood proudly beside Coach Richard. The Golden Team had grown once again, and with each new recruit, their power expanded.
‚ÄúAnother good day‚Äôs work,‚Äù Coach Richard said, his voice filled with pride. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll keep pushing, keep growing. They all obey us eventually.‚Äù
Walter nodded, a satisfied smile on his face. ‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold.‚Äù
The others echoed the mantra, their voices blending into a single, unified chant. The park was theirs, and soon, there would be more parks, more recruits, more gold.
At the other side of the park...
I was in the middle of a perfect slapshot, the whistling through the air, when I saw them coming‚Äîthese guys in golden jerseys. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first. It‚Äôs a park, right? People wear weird stuff all the time. But there was something off about the way they moved. They weren‚Äôt just walking‚Äîthey were converging, fast, in this synchronized, almost military formation.
Then I saw them close in on the basketball game happening across the field. My buddies were laughing and shouting, passing the ball back and forth, completely oblivious to the group of golden-shirted guys surrounding them. My heart jumped, something about the way they moved didn‚Äôt sit right.
Before I could shout a warning, one of the golden guys‚Äîthis huge dude with a smirk‚Äîgrabbed Tim, our goalie. He yanked a shiny gold jersey over Tim's head. It was so quick, almost casual, but the moment that jersey touched him, Tim froze, his whole body locking up like he‚Äôd been hit by a truck. He dropped the ball, eyes wide, and I could see the struggle on his face, like he was trying to fight whatever was happening. But it didn‚Äôt last long. His muscles relaxed, and then, something worse‚Äîhis face twisted into this... this grin, like he was happy, relieved even.
‚ÄúTim! Run!‚Äù I shouted, but it was too late.
The golden guy holding him turned him around so we could all see. Tim‚Äôs back was now emblazoned with a name I didn‚Äôt recognize‚Äî‚ÄúBrad 8.‚Äù I froze in place, stick in hand. That wasn‚Äôt Tim anymore. Brad, whoever that was, nodded, still grinning, and joined the golden guys, completely in sync.
I felt a pit in my stomach. Panic set in as I watched them move to the next one‚ÄîMark. Mark was trying to shove the guys off, but another jersey was already over his head. The moment it touched him, his resistance melted away. His body slumped before straightening into that same eerily obedient posture. He turned around, and sure enough, ‚ÄúBarry 17‚Äù was stitched across his back. Just like that, he was gone too.
That‚Äôs when instinct took over. I dropped my ball and bolted for the trees. I ran so fast I could feel the air burn my lungs, but I didn‚Äôt stop. Not until I was deep into the park‚Äôs wooded area, out of sight. My heart was pounding, and my hands shook as I crouched behind a thick bush, peeking out just enough to watch.
From my hiding spot, I had a clear view of the field. I could still see the others‚Äîthe guys I‚Äôd known for years‚Äîbeing systematically transformed. One by one, those golden jerseys were yanked over their heads, and each time it was the same. First, a struggle, but then... they‚Äôd just stop. Stop fighting, stop thinking, and become part of them. Every time, a new name appeared on their backs‚ÄîHenry, Brock, Chad‚Äîand with it, the person I knew was gone.
The golden guys were chanting something too. I could barely make it out over the wind and rustling trees, but it sounded like, ‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold.‚Äù Over and over again, as if that was the only thing that mattered now.
I saw one of the golden guys grab Alex, the last one left. Alex was a tough dude, always talking about how he‚Äôd never back down from a fight. But he didn‚Äôt stand a chance. They wrestled him to the ground, and soon, he was wearing the same jersey. When he stood up, his back was turned toward me. ‚ÄúCody 23‚Äù was stitched into the gold, as if he‚Äôd never been Alex at all.
I pressed myself harder into the ground, biting back the urge to scream or run again. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing. It was like they weren‚Äôt even human anymore. They laughed, patted each other on the back, but it wasn‚Äôt normal. It was like... like they were all sharing the same brain, like they all belonged to something much bigger than themselves.
I swallowed, my mouth dry. I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt breathe, because if they found me, I knew what would happen. I‚Äôd get a jersey too, and that would be the end of me.
The golden guys, now with my friends‚Äîno, with Brad, Barry, and Cody‚Äîmoved on, searching for more people in the park. They‚Äôd completely forgotten about the game, about the goals and the ball. That wasn‚Äôt their world anymore. It was all about Cap and Gold. That was their new identity, and I was the last one left who wasn‚Äôt part of it.
I stayed there, hidden in the bushes, for what felt like hours. The chanting faded as they moved farther away, leaving me alone in the park that used to be ours. I had to get out of here, but every time I thought about leaving, I remembered the look on Tim‚Äôs‚Äîno, Brad‚Äôs‚Äîface when they took him. That empty, happy grin. I was terrified I‚Äôd see that smile in the reflection of my own face if they caught me.
I waited until the sun began to set before creeping out of my hiding spot, moving quietly through the trees, making sure no one could see me. But as I left, the mantra kept echoing in my head, the same phrase over and over:
‚ÄúWe obey Cap and we obey Gold.‚Äù
It wouldn‚Äôt stop. And a part of me feared that no matter how far I ran, I might still hear it.
1 hour later..
I crept through the trees, my heart still hammering in my chest. The sun was dipping lower, casting long shadows over the park. I thought I was in the clear, that I could escape unnoticed. But as I took a step out of the wooded area, there was a sudden rustling behind me.

Brody took a step forward, his grin widening, and before I could react, two more golden-clad guys appeared from the trees‚ÄîScott and Dean. They had circled me.
‚ÄúCoach is gonna be happy to see you,‚Äù Brody said, his voice so casual, like we were just old friends hanging out. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run from this, man. You‚Äôre part of the team now.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, I‚ÄîI‚Äôm not,‚Äù I stammered, taking a shaky step back. My hands were trembling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like you.‚Äù
Scott chuckled softly. ‚ÄúYou will be.‚Äù
Before I could even think to bolt, Dean moved with lightning speed, grabbing me by the arms. His grip was firm, but not painful. It was almost... comforting. "Don't fight it, bro," he whispered, his voice strangely soothing. "We obey Cap and we obey Gold."
‚ÄúNo! Let me go!‚Äù I yelled, struggling to break free, but Dean held me tight. Brody and Scott stepped forward, both of them pulling a golden jersey from the bag slung over Brody‚Äôs shoulder. My heart pounded in my chest as I realized what was coming.

I nodded, standing up on shaky legs. The transformation had washed away every trace of fear and hesitation, replacing them with something far stronger. I looked at the other guys, at Dean, Scott, and Brody, and I didn‚Äôt just see a group of men‚ÄîI saw my team, my brothers. I was one of them now.

### Maple Heights - Part 1: The Beginning
In the quiet suburban enclave of Maple Heights, everything seemed to have its place. The two-story homes, with their neatly trimmed hedges and spotless driveways, lined the streets in perfect symmetry. It was the kind of neighborhood where everyone waved hello, the lawns were always green, and the local church bells rang every Sunday without fail. Families gathered in the evenings for barbecues, the kids played soccer in the park, and the routine felt timeless.
But recently, something strange had started to creep into Maple Heights. It began with subtle changes that no one could quite put their finger on at first‚Äîlittle things, like men in the neighborhood who began dressing differently, speaking in more structured, rigid ways. Then, almost overnight, more and more of the men started showing up in identical black Fred Perry polos, each one with distinctive yellow details‚Äîa thin stripe running along the collar and cuffs, and the iconic laurel wreath logo embroidered on the chest. These weren't ordinary polos, though. The fabric had a glossy sheen to it, almost rubbery or latex-like, and they were always worn with the top button fastened tight.
The Evans family had been living in Maple Heights for a decade now. Paul and Greg, a married couple raising their three sons‚ÄîLuke, 24; Michael, 22; and Tyler, 20‚Äîhad chosen this neighborhood for its peaceful atmosphere and sense of community. Paul worked from home as a software engineer, while Greg ran the local bakery that everyone in town loved. The boys were a lively bunch, each with their own interests‚ÄîLuke was the athlete, excelling in soccer; Michael spent his time writing music and drawing in his sketchbook; and Tyler, the tech whiz, could be found in his room building gadgets from parts he scavenged at local sales.
Their lives had always been filled with laughter and activity. Weekends meant cookouts in the backyard, bike rides around the block, and movie nights with popcorn on the couch. Church wasn‚Äôt a big part of their routine, but every Sunday, Greg made it a tradition to bake fresh pastries and drop them off at the church before opening the bakery. It was his way of staying connected with the community, even if they weren‚Äôt particularly religious.
But lately, both Paul and Greg had started noticing changes in the neighborhood, especially among the men. It started with Mr. Anderson, two doors down. He had always been friendly‚Äîwaving to Greg every morning as he walked his dog past the bakery. But now, Mr. Anderson was different. His usual flannel shirts and casual jackets had been replaced by a sleek black Fred Perry polo with yellow details. Even stranger, the fabric seemed almost rubbery, the way it caught the light. And the way he buttoned it all the way to the top, stiffly and neatly‚Äîit made him look more formal than usual. His conversation was short, stilted, and somehow‚Ä¶ off.
One evening, as the family gathered around the dinner table, Paul brought it up. ‚ÄúHas anyone else noticed how people around here are dressing differently?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Luke said with a frown. ‚ÄúA bunch of guys at soccer practice started wearing those weird black polos. I mean, they look cool, but... everyone‚Äôs wearing them, like, every day now.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre Fred Perry shirts, right? But they look... shiny,‚Äù Michael added, tapping his fingers against the table in thought. ‚ÄúAnd they all button them up to the top. It‚Äôs kinda weird, like they‚Äôre in some sort of uniform.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the shirts,‚Äù Greg chimed in, shaking his head. ‚ÄúPeople are acting strange, too. Customers at the bakery used to chat, laugh, but now they come in, order the same thing, and barely make eye contact. They‚Äôre so... focused.‚Äù
Tyler, the youngest, leaned forward, eyes wide with curiosity. ‚ÄúI saw a bunch of them after church last week. They were all wearing those black polos. I thought maybe it was some church thing.‚Äù
Paul and Greg exchanged a concerned glance. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like some sort of group,‚Äù Paul said, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all starting to look and act the same.‚Äù
Over the next few weeks, the changes in the neighborhood became more noticeable. More men‚Äîfathers, teachers, even some of the older teens‚Äîwere now dressing in the same glossy black Fred Perry polos, the yellow details standing out sharply against the dark fabric. Each man wore his polo the same way, with the buttons done all the way up to the top, giving them a sleek, almost uniformed appearance. Even their mannerisms had changed‚Äîconversations were short, their expressions calm, almost vacant.
Luke noticed it most on his soccer team. At first, it was just a couple of the players who showed up to practice wearing the polos. But soon, half the team had swapped out their jerseys for the slick, rubbery Fred Perry shirts. And once they did, their personalities shifted. They became more focused, more intense, and eerily synchronized. Luke, who still wore his usual soccer gear, felt out of place. His teammates, now all dressed in the black polos with their yellow accents, would glance at him with strange looks, as if waiting for him to join them.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not wearing one of those,‚Äù Luke said to his dads one night, slumping down on the couch. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all acting weird, like they‚Äôre in some kind of club. And the coach is in on it, too. He wore one at the last game.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the same thing with my friends,‚Äù Michael added. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always wearing those shirts now, and it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt talk about anything else. It‚Äôs not like them.‚Äù
Greg sighed, leaning against the kitchen counter. ‚ÄúEven the customers at the bakery... I‚Äôve noticed more of them wearing the polos. They don‚Äôt smile, they just take their coffee and leave. And today, one of them asked if I wanted to come to some gathering after church this Sunday.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the second time we‚Äôve heard about that,‚Äù Paul said, frowning. ‚ÄúTyler, you said you saw them after church too, right?‚Äù
Tyler nodded, his eyes wide. ‚ÄúYeah, they were all standing around talking after the service. But they weren‚Äôt really talking like normal. It was like they were all... rehearsed.‚Äù
Greg shivered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this.‚Äù
That Sunday, Paul decided to see for himself what was going on. After the church service, while Greg was delivering his pastries, Paul slipped into the side area of the church where the men were gathering. As he stood at the back of the room, he watched them closely. Every man was dressed in the same black Fred Perry polo, the yellow details gleaming under the fluorescent lights. Their shirts were perfectly buttoned up to the top, their expressions calm and focused as they listened to the man leading the meeting. His polo looked newer, glossier than the others, and his voice was firm but soothing as he talked about the ‚Äúimportance of unity‚Äù and ‚Äúthe future of Maple Heights.‚Äù
It was more than just a social group. This was something bigger, something that was spreading.
When Paul got home, he told Greg everything. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the shirts,‚Äù he said, pacing the living room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like they‚Äôre all part of some bigger plan. They‚Äôre getting more men to join them. It‚Äôs like the whole neighborhood is changing.‚Äù
Over the next few weeks, the transformation continued to spread. Luke‚Äôs soccer team was almost fully converted, the boys showing up to practice in their glossy Fred Perry polos, barely speaking to anyone who wasn‚Äôt wearing one. Michael‚Äôs friends had stopped hanging out altogether, and whenever he saw them, they were dressed in the same shirts, their conversations short and emotionless. Even Tyler‚Äôs teachers had begun to show up to class wearing the same outfits.
One afternoon, Greg came home from the bakery with a tight look on his face. He held up a Fred Perry polo‚Äîglossy black with the yellow logo and details‚Äîand tossed it on the kitchen table.
‚ÄúThey gave this to me today,‚Äù Greg said quietly. ‚ÄúThey said it‚Äôs time for me to ‚Äòfit in.‚Äô‚Äù
Paul stared at the shirt, his stomach twisting. ‚ÄúWe need to figure out what‚Äôs really going on, before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù
But deep down, they knew it was already spreading faster than they could stop it. Maple Heights was changing, and it wouldn‚Äôt be long before the entire neighborhood was transformed, one slick black polo at a time.
The next week...
Luke stood on the edge of the soccer field, his cleats digging into the grass as he stared out at his teammates, all of whom were already dressed in their glossy black Fred Perry polos. Their yellow-detailed collars were buttoned up tightly to the top, and the sheen of the shirts gleamed unnaturally in the late afternoon sun. He shifted uncomfortably in his old practice jersey, the only one left who hadn‚Äôt made the switch.
Over the past few weeks, more and more of his teammates had started showing up to practice in the strange uniforms. At first, it was just a few of the guys, but now, every single one of them wore the latex-like black polo. Coach had been pushing them harder too, but in a way that was unnerving. The drills were more intense, more synchronized. The team barely spoke to each other anymore, their conversations replaced by curt instructions and short exchanges.
Luke felt the pressure mounting every time he stepped onto the field. He knew the others noticed that he was the last one holding out. His friends, or who they used to be, barely made eye contact with him anymore. They‚Äôd glance his way with strange, expectant looks, as if waiting for him to join them, to give in.
As practice started, Luke could feel the weight of their eyes on him. He jogged through the drills, but something felt wrong. The usual energy of the game was gone, replaced by an eerie, robotic efficiency. His teammates moved in perfect unison, their movements mechanical, their expressions blank but focused. And all the while, Luke couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that they were watching him‚Äîwaiting for him to fall in line.
‚ÄúLuke!‚Äù Coach‚Äôs voice boomed across the field, pulling him from his thoughts. ‚ÄúCome here.‚Äù
Luke jogged over, his heart pounding. Coach stood on the sidelines, his own black Fred Perry polo perfectly buttoned, the yellow details gleaming in the sun. He had been wearing the shirt for a few weeks now, and ever since then, practice had felt more like a drill session than a sport. The coach‚Äôs eyes locked onto Luke‚Äôs, calm but intense.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the last one,‚Äù Coach said, not unkindly, but with a firmness that sent a chill down Luke‚Äôs spine.
Luke glanced at his teammates, all of them standing in formation, watching silently. ‚ÄúCoach, I‚Äôm just not sure about the mask. I don‚Äôt really feel like I need to wear it,‚Äù Luke said, trying to keep his voice steady.
Coach smiled, but it didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about the mask, Luke. It‚Äôs about unity. The team needs to be united‚Äîon and off the field. You‚Äôve seen how well we‚Äôve been playing lately. We‚Äôre stronger, more focused.‚Äù
Luke shifted uncomfortably, glancing back at his teammates, all eerily still, waiting. He didn‚Äôt want to admit it, but there had been something different about their games recently. They were winning, dominating even. But it didn‚Äôt feel like a team anymore‚Äîit felt like something else, something controlled.
‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for me, Coach,‚Äù Luke said, though his voice faltered. The pressure was mounting, and deep down, he knew he couldn‚Äôt hold out much longer.
Coach‚Äôs smile faded, replaced by a look of quiet authority. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time, Luke. You don‚Äôt have a choice anymore.‚Äù
Before Luke could respond, one of his teammates stepped forward, holding out a neatly folded black Fred Perry polo, the yellow details catching the light. Luke stared at the shirt, his stomach turning. The fabric looked slick, shiny, almost alive, and the thought of putting it on made his skin crawl.
The teammate, a boy who had once been Luke‚Äôs best friend, met his gaze, his expression blank but somehow expectant. ‚ÄúCome on, man,‚Äù he said softly, his voice calm but emotionless. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a shirt.‚Äù
But it wasn‚Äôt just a shirt, and Luke knew it. It was something more. The moment he put it on, he would no longer be himself. He would become just like them‚Äîanother piece of the machine.
Luke stood frozen, his mind racing. He thought of his family, of his dads and his brothers, and how hard they were trying to resist the changes sweeping through the neighborhood. He didn‚Äôt want to give in, but here, on the field, surrounded by his teammates and Coach, he realized he was alone. There was no escape.
Coach stepped forward, his hand resting heavily on Luke‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre part of this team, Luke. You need to be like the rest of us.‚Äù
Luke swallowed hard, his throat dry. He reached out, his hand shaking slightly as he took the shirt from his teammate. The fabric felt slick and cold against his fingers, heavier than he expected. His mind screamed at him to stop, to throw the shirt away and run, but his body didn‚Äôt listen.
Slowly, he pulled the black Fred Perry polo over his head. The latex-like fabric clung to his skin, tightening around him as if it had a will of its own. He adjusted the yellow-detailed collar, his fingers trembling as he buttoned it all the way to the top. The moment the last button clicked into place, a strange warmth spread through him, and his thoughts began to blur.
His mind felt foggy, distant. The resistance he had clung to for so long started to slip away. His shoulders relaxed, and for the first time, he looked at his teammates not with fear or hesitation, but with calm acceptance. The shirt fit perfectly, and for a moment, Luke wondered why he had ever resisted in the first place.
Coach smiled, patting him on the back. ‚ÄúGood. Now you‚Äôre part of the team, put this on.‚Äù
Luke nodded slowly, his mind quiet. He took his place among his teammates, their faces no longer strange or unsettling, but familiar‚Äîlike they had always been. The game started again, and this time, Luke moved with them in perfect unison, every step, every movement synchronized.
As the sun set over the soccer field, the last of Luke‚Äôs resistance faded into the background, replaced by the quiet calm of uniformity. He was no longer an outsider. He was one of them now.
After practice, Luke walked home in silence, the cool evening air brushing against his face. His mind felt strangely still, as if the buzzing thoughts he had carried all day had finally quieted. The black Fred Perry polo with its glossy sheen and yellow details clung snugly to his body, and the weight of it no longer felt strange‚Äîit felt‚Ä¶ right. The top button was fastened tight, and though he had been uncomfortable with it at first, now it felt natural, like it was exactly where it should be.
Luke walked home from practice, the full-face rubber gas mask still tightly fitted over his head. The dark, glossy material gleamed faintly under the streetlights as he passed through the quiet, suburban streets of Maple Heights. The once-familiar neighborhood now felt distant, his breathing slow and controlled through the mask‚Äôs filters, muffling the sounds around him.
His black Fred Perry polo, with its yellow details and buttoned-up collar, clung to him as he walked, the rubber of the mask and the shirt making him feel as though he was locked into something permanent. Each step felt heavy, yet he was calm. His mind was quiet now, his thoughts no longer his own.
As he approached his house, he saw the warm glow of the kitchen lights through the window. For a moment, something stirred inside him‚Äîan echo of the boy he used to be, the Luke who would come home to his dads, joke with his brothers, and feel like himself. But the mask pressed firmly against his face, silencing those thoughts. He reached for the door, knowing they would see him like this.
When he stepped inside, the familiar warmth of home hit him, but it felt different. His dads, Greg and Paul, turned from the kitchen counter, their faces going pale as they saw him standing there, dressed in the glossy black polo and the full-face rubber mask.
‚ÄúLuke?‚Äù Greg‚Äôs voice was filled with shock and concern, but Luke didn‚Äôt respond. He simply stood there, the mask concealing any expression, the filters hissing softly with each breath.
Paul stepped forward, his voice shaky. ‚ÄúTake it off, son. You don‚Äôt have to wear that.‚Äù
But Luke didn‚Äôt move. The mask stayed on, its grip on him firm, the strange calm washing over him once again. He was home, but he wasn‚Äôt the same anymore. And as his dads stared at him in disbelief, Luke knew that the boy they once knew was slipping away.

### Changes: Maple Heights - Part 1: The Beginning
In the quiet suburban enclave of Maple Heights, everything seemed to have its place. The two-story homes, with their neatly trimmed hedges and spotless driveways, lined the streets in perfect symmetry. It was the kind of neighborhood where everyone waved hello, the lawns were always green, and the local church bells rang every Sunday without fail. Families gathered in the evenings for barbecues, the kids played soccer in the park, and the routine felt timeless.
But recently, something strange had started to creep into Maple Heights. It began with subtle changes that no one could quite put their finger on at first‚Äîlittle things, like men in the neighborhood who began dressing differently, speaking in more structured, rigid ways. Then, almost overnight, more and more of the men started showing up in identical black Fred Perry polos, each one with distinctive yellow details‚Äîa thin stripe running along the collar and cuffs, and the iconic laurel wreath logo embroidered on the chest. These weren't ordinary polos, though. The fabric had a glossy sheen to it, almost rubbery or latex-like, and they were always worn with the top button fastened tight.
The Evans family had been living in Maple Heights for a decade now. Paul and Greg, a married couple raising their three sons‚ÄîLuke, 24; Michael, 22; and Tyler, 20‚Äîhad chosen this neighborhood for its peaceful atmosphere and sense of community. Paul worked from home as a software engineer, while Greg ran the local bakery that everyone in town loved. The boys were a lively bunch, each with their own interests‚ÄîLuke was the athlete, excelling in soccer; Michael spent his time writing music and drawing in his sketchbook; and Tyler, the tech whiz, could be found in his room building gadgets from parts he scavenged at local sales.
Their lives had always been filled with laughter and activity. Weekends meant cookouts in the backyard, bike rides around the block, and movie nights with popcorn on the couch. Church wasn‚Äôt a big part of their routine, but every Sunday, Greg made it a tradition to bake fresh pastries and drop them off at the church before opening the bakery. It was his way of staying connected with the community, even if they weren‚Äôt particularly religious.
But lately, both Paul and Greg had started noticing changes in the neighborhood, especially among the men. It started with Mr. Anderson, two doors down. He had always been friendly‚Äîwaving to Greg every morning as he walked his dog past the bakery. But now, Mr. Anderson was different. His usual flannel shirts and casual jackets had been replaced by a sleek black Fred Perry polo with yellow details. Even stranger, the fabric seemed almost rubbery, the way it caught the light. And the way he buttoned it all the way to the top, stiffly and neatly‚Äîit made him look more formal than usual. His conversation was short, stilted, and somehow‚Ä¶ off.
One evening, as the family gathered around the dinner table, Paul brought it up. ‚ÄúHas anyone else noticed how people around here are dressing differently?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Luke said with a frown. ‚ÄúA bunch of guys at soccer practice started wearing those weird black polos. I mean, they look cool, but... everyone‚Äôs wearing them, like, every day now.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre Fred Perry shirts, right? But they look... shiny,‚Äù Michael added, tapping his fingers against the table in thought. ‚ÄúAnd they all button them up to the top. It‚Äôs kinda weird, like they‚Äôre in some sort of uniform.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the shirts,‚Äù Greg chimed in, shaking his head. ‚ÄúPeople are acting strange, too. Customers at the bakery used to chat, laugh, but now they come in, order the same thing, and barely make eye contact. They‚Äôre so... focused.‚Äù
Tyler, the youngest, leaned forward, eyes wide with curiosity. ‚ÄúI saw a bunch of them after church last week. They were all wearing those black polos. I thought maybe it was some church thing.‚Äù
Paul and Greg exchanged a concerned glance. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like some sort of group,‚Äù Paul said, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all starting to look and act the same.‚Äù
Over the next few weeks, the changes in the neighborhood became more noticeable. More men‚Äîfathers, teachers, even some of the older teens‚Äîwere now dressing in the same glossy black Fred Perry polos, the yellow details standing out sharply against the dark fabric. Each man wore his polo the same way, with the buttons done all the way up to the top, giving them a sleek, almost uniformed appearance. Even their mannerisms had changed‚Äîconversations were short, their expressions calm, almost vacant.
Luke noticed it most on his soccer team. At first, it was just a couple of the players who showed up to practice wearing the polos. But soon, half the team had swapped out their jerseys for the slick, rubbery Fred Perry shirts. And once they did, their personalities shifted. They became more focused, more intense, and eerily synchronized. Luke, who still wore his usual soccer gear, felt out of place. His teammates, now all dressed in the black polos with their yellow accents, would glance at him with strange looks, as if waiting for him to join them.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not wearing one of those,‚Äù Luke said to his dads one night, slumping down on the couch. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all acting weird, like they‚Äôre in some kind of club. And the coach is in on it, too. He wore one at the last game.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the same thing with my friends,‚Äù Michael added. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always wearing those shirts now, and it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt talk about anything else. It‚Äôs not like them.‚Äù
Greg sighed, leaning against the kitchen counter. ‚ÄúEven the customers at the bakery... I‚Äôve noticed more of them wearing the polos. They don‚Äôt smile, they just take their coffee and leave. And today, one of them asked if I wanted to come to some gathering after church this Sunday.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the second time we‚Äôve heard about that,‚Äù Paul said, frowning. ‚ÄúTyler, you said you saw them after church too, right?‚Äù
Tyler nodded, his eyes wide. ‚ÄúYeah, they were all standing around talking after the service. But they weren‚Äôt really talking like normal. It was like they were all... rehearsed.‚Äù
Greg shivered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this.‚Äù
That Sunday, Paul decided to see for himself what was going on. After the church service, while Greg was delivering his pastries, Paul slipped into the side area of the church where the men were gathering. As he stood at the back of the room, he watched them closely. Every man was dressed in the same black Fred Perry polo, the yellow details gleaming under the fluorescent lights. Their shirts were perfectly buttoned up to the top, their expressions calm and focused as they listened to the man leading the meeting. His polo looked newer, glossier than the others, and his voice was firm but soothing as he talked about the ‚Äúimportance of unity‚Äù and ‚Äúthe future of Maple Heights.‚Äù
It was more than just a social group. This was something bigger, something that was spreading.
When Paul got home, he told Greg everything. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the shirts,‚Äù he said, pacing the living room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like they‚Äôre all part of some bigger plan. They‚Äôre getting more men to join them. It‚Äôs like the whole neighborhood is changing.‚Äù
Over the next few weeks, the transformation continued to spread. Luke‚Äôs soccer team was almost fully converted, the boys showing up to practice in their glossy Fred Perry polos, barely speaking to anyone who wasn‚Äôt wearing one. Michael‚Äôs friends had stopped hanging out altogether, and whenever he saw them, they were dressed in the same shirts, their conversations short and emotionless. Even Tyler‚Äôs teachers had begun to show up to class wearing the same outfits.
One afternoon, Greg came home from the bakery with a tight look on his face. He held up a Fred Perry polo‚Äîglossy black with the yellow logo and details‚Äîand tossed it on the kitchen table.
‚ÄúThey gave this to me today,‚Äù Greg said quietly. ‚ÄúThey said it‚Äôs time for me to ‚Äòfit in.‚Äô‚Äù
Paul stared at the shirt, his stomach twisting. ‚ÄúWe need to figure out what‚Äôs really going on, before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù
But deep down, they knew it was already spreading faster than they could stop it. Maple Heights was changing, and it wouldn‚Äôt be long before the entire neighborhood was transformed, one slick black polo at a time.

And all the while, Luke couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that they were watching him‚Äîwaiting for him to fall in line.
‚ÄúLuke!‚Äù Coach‚Äôs voice boomed across the field, pulling him from his thoughts. ‚ÄúCome here.‚Äù
Luke jogged over, his heart pounding. Coach stood on the sidelines, his own black Fred Perry polo perfectly buttoned, the yellow details gleaming in the sun. He had been wearing the shirt for a few weeks now, and ever since then, practice had felt more like a drill session than a sport. The coach‚Äôs eyes locked onto Luke‚Äôs, calm but intense.

### Maple Heights - Part 2: The Transforming Party
Tyler could feel the excitement bubbling up as he parked outside Matt‚Äôs house. He hadn‚Äôt seen his best friend in weeks, and this party felt like the perfect way to reconnect. The energy in the air was different tonight, and Tyler was ready to unwind. But what made this night even better was that his friend Alex, a childhood buddy, was coming along too. Tyler hadn‚Äôt told Alex about the strange changes happening with his brother Luke, or the bizarre polo shirt trend he‚Äôd noticed at home and around town‚Äîtonight was just about fun.
Tyler checked his phone. A text from Alex popped up: "Here. Meet me at the front!"
He stepped out of his car and spotted Alex approaching from down the street. They gave each other a quick bro-hug and laughed, reminiscing about old times as they walked toward the house.
"Man, I haven‚Äôt been to one of Matt‚Äôs parties in ages. Should be fun," Alex said, grinning.
Tyler smiled but felt a knot forming in his stomach. Something had been bothering him ever since he heard about Matt wearing the black latex Fred Perry polo. He hadn‚Äôt been able to get a clear answer from Matt about it, and his gut told him something was wrong. But tonight, he wasn‚Äôt going to worry about it‚Äîat least, not yet.
As they stepped into Matt‚Äôs house, the music was thumping, and the place was packed with people in their twenties, dancing and chatting. Tyler immediately spotted Matt in the kitchen, surrounded by a group of guys. As he approached, he saw it‚Äîthe same black latex Fred Perry polo with yellow details that he‚Äôd seen on Luke and other guys recently. It fit Matt tightly, gleaming under the lights in a way that made it impossible to ignore.
Alex didn‚Äôt seem to notice the shirt, instead excitedly talking about plans for the weekend. But Tyler‚Äôs eyes stayed glued to the polo. He had to ask.
"Matt, dude, what's with the shirt?" Tyler asked, trying to sound casual.
Matt smiled‚Äîan eerie, too-perfect smile. "It‚Äôs the new thing, Ty. You‚Äôll see. Come on, man, relax. Let‚Äôs grab a drink."
Tyler and Alex exchanged a glance. Alex‚Äôs smile faded a bit, as if sensing something was off too. Still, they both decided to go with the flow‚Äîfor now.
Later, Tyler and Alex managed to slip outside to the backyard, trying to get away from the growing crowd inside. The backyard was quieter, but Tyler couldn‚Äôt shake the weird feeling. Matt had always been the most laid-back guy, but now there was something different about him‚Äîsomething controlled.
"Hey, man," Alex said, breaking Tyler‚Äôs thoughts. "What‚Äôs going on? You seem tense."
Tyler glanced toward the house, lowering his voice. "It‚Äôs Matt. And it‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ shirt. I don‚Äôt know, but something‚Äôs up. Everyone‚Äôs been wearing these black latex polos lately. My brother, some guys from the neighborhood‚Äîit‚Äôs spreading."
Alex frowned. "You think Matt‚Äôs involved?"
"I don‚Äôt know," Tyler admitted. "But something isn‚Äôt right."
Just as they were talking, Matt stepped outside. Tyler tensed, but Matt‚Äôs smile seemed genuine‚Äîyet eerie. He approached them with a drink in hand and, without prompting, began talking.
"You know, Tyler, I wasn‚Äôt sure about it either at first," Matt said, his tone unusually calm. "But once I met the coach, everything made sense."
Tyler stiffened. "Coach? What coach?"
"Coach Johnson. The guy who runs the soccer team. He‚Äôs the one who introduced me to the polo. Said it‚Äôs about more than just soccer. It‚Äôs about focus, clarity‚Ä¶ success. It changes you, Ty. Makes you better."
Tyler‚Äôs heart raced. His mind flashed back to his brother, Luke, who had been acting strange ever since soccer practice. The pieces started falling into place. "You mean Coach Johnson turned you?"
Matt‚Äôs eyes gleamed in the low light. "Not just me. A lot of us. It‚Äôs spreading through the town. The polo‚Äîit connects us. You‚Äôll understand once you wear it."
Alex leaned in, whispering, "Tyler, this is messed up."
The night took a darker turn when a group of new guests arrived. They were all dressed in normal clothes‚Äîjeans and casual shirts. Tyler watched as Matt and a few other guys in the black polos welcomed them with wide smiles, offering them drinks. But Tyler noticed something strange: whenever Matt or another guy handed out a drink, they also handed out a folded black latex Fred Perry polo.
Tyler‚Äôs stomach dropped as he watched the scene unfold. At first, the new arrivals hesitated, just like Jason had earlier, but after some encouragement, they began putting on the polos. And even.. gas masks?
One by one, the men‚Äôs expressions shifted from confusion to calmness. They began to mirror the behavior of the other guys already transformed. Their casual clothes were discarded, and the black latex polos with yellow details took their place, shimmering eerily under the house lights.
Alex grabbed Tyler‚Äôs arm. "We need to get out of here."
Tyler nodded, but before they could leave, the door to the backyard opened again‚Äîand this time, Coach Johnson stepped through. He, too, was wearing the black polo. His presence was commanding, and everyone turned toward him.
"Tyler," Coach Johnson called out, his voice smooth and authoritative. "It‚Äôs time for you to join the team."
Tyler‚Äôs blood ran cold. "I‚Äôm not doing this."
But then he saw them‚Äîtwo men standing behind Coach Johnson. He recognized them immediately‚Äîthey were the brothers of two guys he had grown up with. And just like everyone else, they too were wearing the polos. The brothers‚Äô expressions were calm, eerily serene.
Matt stepped closer, holding out a black polo with yellow details. "It‚Äôs inevitable, Ty. Put it on, and you‚Äôll understand."
Alex looked at Tyler, his eyes filled with fear. "Tyler, don‚Äôt do it."
Tyler‚Äôs heart pounded in his chest. The black latex Fred Perry polo gleamed in Matt‚Äôs hands, and Coach Johnson stood nearby, watching Tyler with calm, knowing eyes. The parents behind Coach‚Äîmen Tyler had known all his life‚Äîwere wearing the same polos, their faces eerily serene. This wasn‚Äôt just about soccer anymore; this was something much bigger, much more terrifying.
Alex gripped Tyler‚Äôs arm tightly, his voice low but urgent. ‚ÄúTyler, we have to get out of here. Now.‚Äù
But Tyler couldn‚Äôt move. His mind was racing, trying to piece everything together. Matt had been turned by Coach Johnson. His brother Luke had fallen into the same trap. And now it was spreading‚Äîthrough the neighborhood, through the town. What had once seemed like an innocent trend was now a full-blown takeover.
The air felt thick around him, the weight of expectation pressing down. Everyone at the party‚Äîthe guys in their twenties, the parents, even his best friend‚Äîwas looking at him, waiting for him to make the choice. And the polo... it was right there, just inches from his hands.
Matt‚Äôs voice broke the silence. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to fight it, Ty. The polo will change everything. It‚Äôll give you focus. Clarity. You‚Äôll be part of something bigger than yourself.‚Äù
Tyler shook his head, trying to resist. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want that.‚Äù
But Matt‚Äôs expression softened, and for a moment, Tyler saw a flicker of the old Matt‚Äîthe friend he had grown up with. ‚ÄúI thought the same thing at first. I didn‚Äôt understand it. But once I wore the polo, everything made sense. You‚Äôll feel it too.‚Äù
Tyler‚Äôs eyes darted to Alex, who was still gripping his arm, silently pleading for them to leave. But as Tyler‚Äôs gaze swept the backyard, he realized something chilling: the exit was blocked. Two more guys in black polos were standing near the gate, their faces blank but watchful.
There was no way out.
‚ÄúTyler!‚Äù Coach Johnson‚Äôs voice boomed across the backyard, snapping Tyler back to attention. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to make a decision.‚Äù
Tyler‚Äôs breath caught in his throat. He didn‚Äôt know what to do. He couldn‚Äôt just run‚Äîthey were surrounded. And if he refused to wear the polo, what would happen? Would they force it on him? Would they make him like they had made Matt, Luke, and the others?
Alex‚Äôs voice broke through his thoughts. ‚ÄúTy, we can‚Äôt stay here. We have to fight this.‚Äù
But Tyler was paralyzed. The weight of the polo in Matt‚Äôs hands seemed to pull him closer. The promise of focus, of clarity, of belonging‚Äîit was tempting, even though he knew it was wrong.
Coach Johnson stepped forward, his face calm, almost fatherly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been strong, Tyler. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôve resisted this for so long. But strength doesn‚Äôt come from standing alone. It comes from being part of a team. And this... this is the ultimate team.‚Äù
Tyler‚Äôs mind flashed to his brother Luke‚Äîhow different he had become since soccer practice, how distant but focused. And then he thought about Matt, who had always been the most laid-back guy he knew, now a willing servant of whatever force was behind this polo.
‚ÄúI... I don‚Äôt want to be like this,‚Äù Tyler whispered, more to himself than anyone else.
Matt stepped closer, holding out the polo. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt lose who you are, Ty. You‚Äôll just... be better. You‚Äôll understand.‚Äù
Alex pulled Tyler back a step, his voice rising. ‚ÄúNo! This isn‚Äôt you, Tyler. You‚Äôre stronger than this!‚Äù
But as Alex spoke, Coach Johnson‚Äôs eyes narrowed. He gestured to one of the guys standing near the gate, who moved silently toward Alex, grabbing his arm and twisting him around. Alex yelped in pain, and before Tyler could react, the guy pulled a folded black polo from his jacket and shoved it toward Alex.
‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Tyler shouted, moving to intervene, but it was too late.
In a swift, practiced motion, Alex was forced to his knees as the polo was yanked over his head. The black latex gleamed in the moonlight, and Tyler watched in horror as Alex‚Äôs expression changed. The panic in his eyes faded, replaced by a calm, almost empty look. The transformation was fast, brutal.
When Alex stood up again, he was different. His eyes no longer held that spark of rebellion. Instead, they were distant, calm, and focused‚Äîjust like everyone else‚Äôs.
‚ÄúTyler,‚Äù Alex said softly, his voice flat, emotionless. ‚ÄúYou should put it on.‚Äù
Tyler‚Äôs heart sank. His last ally was gone, taken by the same force that had claimed so many others. Now, there was no one left to fight alongside him.
Coach Johnson stepped forward again, his expression unreadable. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to fight anymore, Tyler. The polo is waiting for you. Once you wear it, everything will fall into place. You‚Äôll be part of the team.‚Äù
Matt smiled, holding out the shirt one final time.
Tyler‚Äôs hands shook. He could feel the pressure building, the weight of everyone‚Äôs eyes on him. There was no way out, no one left to help him. The polo felt inevitable.
But just as he reached out to take it, a memory flashed in his mind‚Äîa memory of him and Luke playing soccer in the backyard as kids, before everything had changed. They had always been a team, but it had been on their terms. This... this wasn‚Äôt a team. It was control.
Tyler took a deep breath. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do it,‚Äù he said quietly.
Matt‚Äôs smile faltered. ‚ÄúTy, don‚Äôt be stupid.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not putting it on,‚Äù Tyler repeated, louder this time.
Coach Johnson‚Äôs eyes darkened. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a choice.‚Äù
But Tyler took a step back, refusing to take the polo. ‚ÄúYes, I do.‚Äù
For a moment, the world seemed to stand still. The air was thick with tension, and Tyler could feel the weight of his decision pressing down on him. But he stood firm.
Coach Johnson‚Äôs lips pressed into a thin line. ‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù
And with that, he gave a curt nod to the two men by the gate. They moved toward Tyler, fast and efficient, ready to force the transformation on him.
But before they could reach him, Tyler bolted. He ran through the crowd, pushing past the guys in black polos, ignoring the shocked gasps and protests. He didn‚Äôt know where he was going‚Äîhe just knew he had to get out.
Alex, now with his hair slicked back, was ready to find his best friend and make him join them forever.
Tyler‚Äôs feet pounded against the pavement as he sprinted down the street, the cool night air filling his lungs. Behind him, he could hear the shouts of the transformed, but he didn‚Äôt look back. His only thought was escape.
He ran and ran until the sounds of pursuit faded into the distance. Only then did he stop, gasping for breath. He was alone, in the middle of a quiet, empty street.
For now, he had escaped. But Tyler knew it wasn‚Äôt over. The black polo was everywhere‚Äîspreading through the town like wildfire. And sooner or later, they would come for him again.
Tyler sprinted down the empty suburban street, his heart pounding as he put more distance between himself and the house. His mind raced with fear and confusion‚Äîhis friends, his neighbors, everyone he knew was falling under the influence of those black Fred Perry polos. But he couldn‚Äôt stop, not now.
Just as he rounded a corner and ducked behind a row of parked cars to catch his breath, his phone buzzed. He fumbled for it, seeing Zach‚Äôs name on the screen. Surprised but relieved, he answered quickly.
‚ÄúZach?‚Äù Tyler whispered, glancing around to make sure he was alone. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? Are you okay?‚Äù
There was a shaky intake of breath on the other end. ‚ÄúTyler‚Ä¶ man, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening,‚Äù Zach whispered, his voice quivering with fear. ‚ÄúMy dad‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs changed. Just like everyone else. He keeps telling me I need to put on the polo, that it‚Äôll make everything better.‚Äù
Tyler felt a chill run down his spine. ‚ÄúZach, listen to me. You have to get out of there. Don‚Äôt let him make you put it on. They‚Äôre all‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre not themselves anymore. We have to get somewhere safe.‚Äù
There was a rustling sound on the line, and Zach‚Äôs voice dropped to a near whisper. ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôm trying. I‚Äôve been hiding in my room, but he won‚Äôt stop. He keeps knocking on the door, saying it‚Äôs for my own good. Ty, I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can hold him off.‚Äù
Tyler‚Äôs pulse quickened. ‚ÄúCan you make it to the soccer fields? It‚Äôs abandoned; no one will look for us there.‚Äù
There was a moment of silence, and then Zach replied, ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll try. Just‚Äîwait, no! No, Dad, don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù
Suddenly, there was a muffled scuffle on the other end of the line, followed by Zach‚Äôs voice calling out, ‚ÄúNo! I don‚Äôt want it! I don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù And then the call went silent.
Tyler stared at his phone, his heart hammering as dread washed over him. Zach was, just like his brother Troy, gone. Their father was pleased.
Tyler sprinted down the dark streets, adrenaline pushing him forward. His heart pounded as he turned corner after corner, his mind racing. He knew they were close, and he had no choice but to keep running. The voices of the transformed echoed faintly behind him, calling his name, urging him to stop fighting.
He needed somewhere to hide‚Äîsomewhere he could catch his breath, think, and maybe even find a way to fight back.
Before he knew it, he found himself at the edge of the familiar soccer field where Luke had practiced countless times. The field was empty now, the bleachers casting long shadows under the moonlight. But Tyler couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of being watched, of something lurking beneath the surface. He spotted the locker room building near the bleachers and made a break for it, slipping inside and quietly closing the door behind him.
The air inside the locker room was thick and heavy, carrying a distinct, musky scent. Tyler wrinkled his nose, trying to ignore it as he moved deeper into the room. But the smell only intensified as he walked further, and he soon realized the source: dozens of black Fred Perry polos, identical to the ones he had seen at the party, were hanging on racks along the walls. Their yellow details caught the dim light, creating an almost hypnotic effect as they swayed slightly.
The faint hum of a ceiling fan was the only sound as he pushed the door open of coach his office. Inside, the room was dark, illuminated only by a small desk lamp casting a pool of light over the cluttered desk. Tyler‚Äôs gaze fell on a stack of papers and a checklist lying on top, each item written in Coach‚Äôs neat, meticulous handwriting.
The final line sat unchecked, standing out in a haunting way. Tyler‚Äôs chest tightened as he realized this was more than a casual plan‚ÄîCoach had orchestrated everything.
He took a slow step forward, drawn to the wall on the far side of the room. It was covered with framed photos, each one spotlighting different moments and faces. His eyes widened as he recognized the faces in the photos. There was Luke, his brother, standing proudly in a black Fred Perry polo with yellow details, his face calm and focused. Below Luke‚Äôs photo was a small label, handwritten in bold letters: Polo Drone 088.
Tyler‚Äôs breath hitched as he scanned the other photos. There was Matt, Alex, and others from the soccer team, all wearing the same polo with the same serene, almost detached expressions. In the center of it all, a larger framed photo of Coach Johnson (Polo Drone 001) stared back at him, his gaze intense and commanding. Tyler could feel the weight of Coach‚Äôs stare, as if it reached out from the photo, binding him in place.
The room was completely silent, and he felt both comforted and unnerved by the eerie calm. He crouched down behind a row of lockers, breathing deeply as he tried to steady himself. But each breath filled his lungs with the overwhelming musk from the polos, a heady, almost intoxicating scent that made his mind feel hazy.
Tyler‚Äôs head began to swim, the scent sinking deeper into his senses. He knew he needed to stay alert, to keep his guard up, but his resistance was slipping with each breath he took. His heart still pounded, but it was slower now, his thoughts beginning to drift. The scent was comforting, reassuring, like a gentle voice telling him everything would be alright if he just‚Ä¶ gave in.
He tried to shake his head, to clear his mind, but it only seemed to make the pull of the polos stronger. His gaze drifted to the neatly arranged rows, their soft fabric glinting faintly in the low light, calling to him.
‚ÄúIt would be so easy,‚Äù a voice in his mind whispered. ‚ÄúJust one step, and all the running, all the fear, would go away.‚Äù
Tyler shook his head again, trying to resist. But his hands seemed to move on their own, reaching out toward one of the polos hanging on the nearest rack. The fabric felt cool under his fingertips, and a strange sense of calm washed over him as he held it in his hands.
He brought the polo closer, his mind growing hazier as the musky scent became overpowering. His grip tightened, the soft fabric pulling him in, his fingers tracing the yellow details almost instinctively.
The room felt warmer now, the silence enveloping him like a blanket. Tyler‚Äôs resistance faded with each passing moment, the familiar scent and the feel of the polo overpowering his senses. It was as if the shirt itself was speaking to him, urging him to embrace the calm, the unity it promised.
As if in a trance, Tyler slowly slipped the polo over his head. The moment it touched his skin, he felt a strange peace settle over him, his thoughts quieting, his body relaxing as if it had found its purpose. The musky scent filled his lungs, grounding him, connecting him to something greater.
He looked down at himself, at the shiny black polo that now clung to his body. The yellow details gleamed in the dim light, and his fingers brushed over the fabric, feeling a sense of pride he couldn‚Äôt explain.
His mind was empty, his fear gone, replaced by the steady, calm focus he had seen in his brother, in Matt, and in Alex. He was no longer Tyler, the one who resisted. He was part of something bigger now, something that filled him with purpose.
As he stepped out of the locker room, his movements were calm, controlled, each step aligning with the rhythm of the voices that had once chased him. Now, he was one of them, ready to bring others into the fold.
The night felt different now. The world around Tyler was still, serene, as he walked back toward his house. The familiar streetlights cast a faint glow on the shiny black Fred Perry polo he now wore, its yellow accents catching the light in a way that felt almost otherworldly. Tyler moved with calm purpose, the faint, lingering musk from the locker room grounding him with each step.
When he reached the doorstep of his home, he paused, taking a slow breath as he felt a sense of clarity wash over him. Everything had fallen into place.
Inside, the house was quiet, the soft glow from a single lamp spilling into the hall. Tyler made his way toward the living room, where he found his brother, Luke, sitting calmly on the couch. Luke looked up, his gaze unwavering, his own polo a perfect match to Tyler‚Äôs.
‚ÄúWelcome home, Ty,‚Äù Luke said, his tone warm but calm, as if he had been waiting for this moment.
Tyler moved to sit beside his brother, feeling a strange sense of peace. The resistance, the confusion, all of it felt like a distant memory, replaced by the quiet purpose they now shared.
They sat in silence, basking in their newfound unity. After a few moments, Luke‚Äôs gaze drifted toward the hallway closet, and a faint smile tugged at his lips.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost complete now,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúCoach said there‚Äôs always room for more.‚Äù
Tyler‚Äôs gaze followed his brother‚Äôs, and there, nestled in the back of the closet, he noticed three neatly folded black polos, each one identical to theirs, the yellow accents gleaming softly under the light.
Their father‚Äôs voice sounded from upstairs, a hint of curiosity in his tone. ‚ÄúTyler? Luke? Is that you boys?‚Äù
Tyler and Luke exchanged a knowing look, their smiles widening ever so slightly. They both rose from the couch, moving with quiet, steady steps toward the hallway closet, each of them taking a polo from the pile.
The house was silent as they made their way up the stairs, their expressions calm, their purpose clear.
And as they disappeared into the shadows of the hallway, the last light in the house went out, leaving only the faint scent of musk lingering in the air.

### Changes: Maple Heights - Part 2: The Transforming Party
Tyler could feel the excitement bubbling up as he parked outside Matt‚Äôs house. He hadn‚Äôt seen his best friend in weeks, and this party felt like the perfect way to reconnect. The energy in the air was different tonight, and Tyler was ready to unwind. But what made this night even better was that his friend Alex, a childhood buddy, was coming along too. Tyler hadn‚Äôt told Alex about the strange changes happening with his brother Luke, or the bizarre polo shirt trend he‚Äôd noticed at home and around town‚Äîtonight was just about fun.
Tyler checked his phone. A text from Alex popped up: "Here. Meet me at the front!"
He stepped out of his car and spotted Alex approaching from down the street. They gave each other a quick bro-hug and laughed, reminiscing about old times as they walked toward the house.
"Man, I haven‚Äôt been to one of Matt‚Äôs parties in ages. Should be fun," Alex said, grinning.
Tyler smiled but felt a knot forming in his stomach. Something had been bothering him ever since he heard about Matt wearing the black latex Fred Perry polo. He hadn‚Äôt been able to get a clear answer from Matt about it, and his gut told him something was wrong. But tonight, he wasn‚Äôt going to worry about it‚Äîat least, not yet.
As they stepped into Matt‚Äôs house, the music was thumping, and the place was packed with people in their twenties, dancing and chatting. Tyler immediately spotted Matt in the kitchen, surrounded by a group of guys. As he approached, he saw it‚Äîthe same black latex Fred Perry polo with yellow details that he‚Äôd seen on Luke and other guys recently. It fit Matt tightly, gleaming under the lights in a way that made it impossible to ignore.
Alex didn‚Äôt seem to notice the shirt, instead excitedly talking about plans for the weekend. But Tyler‚Äôs eyes stayed glued to the polo. He had to ask.
"Matt, dude, what's with the shirt?" Tyler asked, trying to sound casual.
Matt smiled‚Äîan eerie, too-perfect smile. "It‚Äôs the new thing, Ty. You‚Äôll see. Come on, man, relax. Let‚Äôs grab a drink."
Tyler and Alex exchanged a glance. Alex‚Äôs smile faded a bit, as if sensing something was off too. Still, they both decided to go with the flow‚Äîfor now.
Later, Tyler and Alex managed to slip outside to the backyard, trying to get away from the growing crowd inside. The backyard was quieter, but Tyler couldn‚Äôt shake the weird feeling. Matt had always been the most laid-back guy, but now there was something different about him‚Äîsomething controlled.
"Hey, man," Alex said, breaking Tyler‚Äôs thoughts. "What‚Äôs going on? You seem tense."
Tyler glanced toward the house, lowering his voice. "It‚Äôs Matt. And it‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ shirt. I don‚Äôt know, but something‚Äôs up. Everyone‚Äôs been wearing these black latex polos lately. My brother, some guys from the neighborhood‚Äîit‚Äôs spreading."
Alex frowned. "You think Matt‚Äôs involved?"
"I don‚Äôt know," Tyler admitted. "But something isn‚Äôt right."
Just as they were talking, Matt stepped outside. Tyler tensed, but Matt‚Äôs smile seemed genuine‚Äîyet eerie. He approached them with a drink in hand and, without prompting, began talking.
"You know, Tyler, I wasn‚Äôt sure about it either at first," Matt said, his tone unusually calm. "But once I met the coach, everything made sense."
Tyler stiffened. "Coach? What coach?"
"Coach Johnson. The guy who runs the soccer team. He‚Äôs the one who introduced me to the polo. Said it‚Äôs about more than just soccer. It‚Äôs about focus, clarity‚Ä¶ success. It changes you, Ty. Makes you better."
Tyler‚Äôs heart raced. His mind flashed back to his brother, Luke, who had been acting strange ever since soccer practice. The pieces started falling into place. "You mean Coach Johnson turned you?"
Matt‚Äôs eyes gleamed in the low light. "Not just me. A lot of us. It‚Äôs spreading through the town. The polo‚Äîit connects us. You‚Äôll understand once you wear it."
Alex leaned in, whispering, "Tyler, this is messed up."
The night took a darker turn when a group of new guests arrived. They were all dressed in normal clothes‚Äîjeans and casual shirts. Tyler watched as Matt and a few other guys in the black polos welcomed them with wide smiles, offering them drinks. But Tyler noticed something strange: whenever Matt or another guy handed out a drink, they also handed out a folded black latex Fred Perry polo.
Tyler‚Äôs stomach dropped as he watched the scene unfold. At first, the new arrivals hesitated, just like Jason had earlier, but after some encouragement, they began putting on the polos. And even.. gas masks?
One by one, the men‚Äôs expressions shifted from confusion to calmness. They began to mirror the behavior of the other guys already transformed. Their casual clothes were discarded, and the black latex polos with yellow details took their place, shimmering eerily under the house lights.
Alex grabbed Tyler‚Äôs arm. "We need to get out of here."
Tyler nodded, but before they could leave, the door to the backyard opened again‚Äîand this time, Coach Johnson stepped through. He, too, was wearing the black polo. His presence was commanding, and everyone turned toward him.
"Tyler," Coach Johnson called out, his voice smooth and authoritative. "It‚Äôs time for you to join the team."
Tyler‚Äôs blood ran cold. "I‚Äôm not doing this."
But then he saw them‚Äîtwo men standing behind Coach Johnson. He recognized them immediately‚Äîthey were the brothers of two guys he had grown up with. And just like everyone else, they too were wearing the polos. The brothers‚Äô expressions were calm, eerily serene.
Matt stepped closer, holding out a black polo with yellow details. "It‚Äôs inevitable, Ty. Put it on, and you‚Äôll understand."
Alex looked at Tyler, his eyes filled with fear. "Tyler, don‚Äôt do it."
Tyler‚Äôs heart pounded in his chest. The black latex Fred Perry polo gleamed in Matt‚Äôs hands, and Coach Johnson stood nearby, watching Tyler with calm, knowing eyes. The parents behind Coach‚Äîmen Tyler had known all his life‚Äîwere wearing the same polos, their faces eerily serene. This wasn‚Äôt just about soccer anymore; this was something much bigger, much more terrifying.
Alex gripped Tyler‚Äôs arm tightly, his voice low but urgent. ‚ÄúTyler, we have to get out of here. Now.‚Äù
But Tyler couldn‚Äôt move. His mind was racing, trying to piece everything together. Matt had been turned by Coach Johnson. His brother Luke had fallen into the same trap. And now it was spreading‚Äîthrough the neighborhood, through the town. What had once seemed like an innocent trend was now a full-blown takeover.
The air felt thick around him, the weight of expectation pressing down. Everyone at the party‚Äîthe guys in their twenties, the parents, even his best friend‚Äîwas looking at him, waiting for him to make the choice. And the polo... it was right there, just inches from his hands.
Matt‚Äôs voice broke the silence. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to fight it, Ty. The polo will change everything. It‚Äôll give you focus. Clarity. You‚Äôll be part of something bigger than yourself.‚Äù
Tyler shook his head, trying to resist. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want that.‚Äù

There was no way out.
‚ÄúTyler!‚Äù Coach Johnson‚Äôs voice boomed across the backyard, snapping Tyler back to attention. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to make a decision.‚Äù
Tyler‚Äôs breath caught in his throat. He didn‚Äôt know what to do. He couldn‚Äôt just run‚Äîthey were surrounded. And if he refused to wear the polo, what would happen? Would they force it on him? Would they make him like they had made Matt, Luke, and the others?
Alex‚Äôs voice broke through his thoughts. ‚ÄúTy, we can‚Äôt stay here. We have to fight this.‚Äù
But Tyler was paralyzed. The weight of the polo in Matt‚Äôs hands seemed to pull him closer. The promise of focus, of clarity, of belonging‚Äîit was tempting, even though he knew it was wrong.
Coach Johnson stepped forward, his face calm, almost fatherly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been strong, Tyler. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôve resisted this for so long. But strength doesn‚Äôt come from standing alone. It comes from being part of a team. And this... this is the ultimate team.‚Äù
Tyler‚Äôs mind flashed to his brother Luke‚Äîhow different he had become since soccer practice, how distant but focused. And then he thought about Matt, who had always been the most laid-back guy he knew, now a willing servant of whatever force was behind this polo.
‚ÄúI... I don‚Äôt want to be like this,‚Äù Tyler whispered, more to himself than anyone else.
Matt stepped closer, holding out the polo. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt lose who you are, Ty. You‚Äôll just... be better. You‚Äôll understand.‚Äù
Alex pulled Tyler back a step, his voice rising. ‚ÄúNo! This isn‚Äôt you, Tyler. You‚Äôre stronger than this!‚Äù
But as Alex spoke, Coach Johnson‚Äôs eyes narrowed. He gestured to one of the guys standing near the gate, who moved silently toward Alex, grabbing his arm and twisting him around. Alex yelped in pain, and before Tyler could react, the guy pulled a folded black polo from his jacket and shoved it toward Alex.

Tyler took a deep breath. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do it,‚Äù he said quietly.
Matt‚Äôs smile faltered. ‚ÄúTy, don‚Äôt be stupid.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not putting it on,‚Äù Tyler repeated, louder this time.
Coach Johnson‚Äôs eyes darkened. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a choice.‚Äù
But Tyler took a step back, refusing to take the polo. ‚ÄúYes, I do.‚Äù
For a moment, the world seemed to stand still. The air was thick with tension, and Tyler could feel the weight of his decision pressing down on him. But he stood firm.
Coach Johnson‚Äôs lips pressed into a thin line. ‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù
And with that, he gave a curt nod to the two men by the gate. They moved toward Tyler, fast and efficient, ready to force the transformation on him.
But before they could reach him, Tyler bolted. He ran through the crowd, pushing past the guys in black polos, ignoring the shocked gasps and protests. He didn‚Äôt know where he was going‚Äîhe just knew he had to get out.

‚ÄúZach?‚Äù Tyler whispered, glancing around to make sure he was alone. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? Are you okay?‚Äù
There was a shaky intake of breath on the other end. ‚ÄúTyler‚Ä¶ man, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening,‚Äù Zach whispered, his voice quivering with fear. ‚ÄúMy dad‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs changed. Just like everyone else. He keeps telling me I need to put on the polo, that it‚Äôll make everything better.‚Äù
Tyler felt a chill run down his spine. ‚ÄúZach, listen to me. You have to get out of there. Don‚Äôt let him make you put it on. They‚Äôre all‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre not themselves anymore. We have to get somewhere safe.‚Äù
There was a rustling sound on the line, and Zach‚Äôs voice dropped to a near whisper. ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôm trying. I‚Äôve been hiding in my room, but he won‚Äôt stop. He keeps knocking on the door, saying it‚Äôs for my own good. Ty, I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can hold him off.‚Äù
Tyler‚Äôs pulse quickened. ‚ÄúCan you make it to the soccer fields? It‚Äôs abandoned; no one will look for us there.‚Äù
There was a moment of silence, and then Zach replied, ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll try. Just‚Äîwait, no! No, Dad, don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù
Suddenly, there was a muffled scuffle on the other end of the line, followed by Zach‚Äôs voice calling out, ‚ÄúNo! I don‚Äôt want it! I don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù And then the call went silent.
Tyler stared at his phone, his heart hammering as dread washed over him. Zach was, just like his brother Troy, gone. Their father was pleased.
Tyler sprinted down the dark streets, adrenaline pushing him forward. His heart pounded as he turned corner after corner, his mind racing. He knew they were close, and he had no choice but to keep running. The voices of the transformed echoed faintly behind him, calling his name, urging him to stop fighting.
He needed somewhere to hide‚Äîsomewhere he could catch his breath, think, and maybe even find a way to fight back.
Before he knew it, he found himself at the edge of the familiar soccer field where Luke had practiced countless times. The field was empty now, the bleachers casting long shadows under the moonlight. But Tyler couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of being watched, of something lurking beneath the surface. He spotted the locker room building near the bleachers and made a break for it, slipping inside and quietly closing the door behind him.
The air inside the locker room was thick and heavy, carrying a distinct, musky scent. Tyler wrinkled his nose, trying to ignore it as he moved deeper into the room. But the smell only intensified as he walked further, and he soon realized the source: dozens of black Fred Perry polos, identical to the ones he had seen at the party, were hanging on racks along the walls. Their yellow details caught the dim light, creating an almost hypnotic effect as they swayed slightly.
The faint hum of a ceiling fan was the only sound as he pushed the door open of coach his office. Inside, the room was dark, illuminated only by a small desk lamp casting a pool of light over the cluttered desk. Tyler‚Äôs gaze fell on a stack of papers and a checklist lying on top, each item written in Coach‚Äôs neat, meticulous handwriting.
The final line sat unchecked, standing out in a haunting way. Tyler‚Äôs chest tightened as he realized this was more than a casual plan‚ÄîCoach had orchestrated everything.
He took a slow step forward, drawn to the wall on the far side of the room. It was covered with framed photos, each one spotlighting different moments and faces. His eyes widened as he recognized the faces in the photos. There was Luke, his brother, standing proudly in a black Fred Perry polo with yellow details, his face calm and focused. Below Luke‚Äôs photo was a small label, handwritten in bold letters: Polo Drone 088.
Tyler‚Äôs breath hitched as he scanned the other photos. There was Matt, Alex, and others from the soccer team, all wearing the same polo with the same serene, almost detached expressions. In the center of it all, a larger framed photo of Coach Johnson (Polo Drone 001) stared back at him, his gaze intense and commanding. Tyler could feel the weight of Coach‚Äôs stare, as if it reached out from the photo, binding him in place.
The room was completely silent, and he felt both comforted and unnerved by the eerie calm. He crouched down behind a row of lockers, breathing deeply as he tried to steady himself. But each breath filled his lungs with the overwhelming musk from the polos, a heady, almost intoxicating scent that made his mind feel hazy.
Tyler‚Äôs head began to swim, the scent sinking deeper into his senses. He knew he needed to stay alert, to keep his guard up, but his resistance was slipping with each breath he took. His heart still pounded, but it was slower now, his thoughts beginning to drift. The scent was comforting, reassuring, like a gentle voice telling him everything would be alright if he just‚Ä¶ gave in.
He tried to shake his head, to clear his mind, but it only seemed to make the pull of the polos stronger. His gaze drifted to the neatly arranged rows, their soft fabric glinting faintly in the low light, calling to him.
‚ÄúIt would be so easy,‚Äù a voice in his mind whispered. ‚ÄúJust one step, and all the running, all the fear, would go away.‚Äù
Tyler shook his head again, trying to resist. But his hands seemed to move on their own, reaching out toward one of the polos hanging on the nearest rack. The fabric felt cool under his fingertips, and a strange sense of calm washed over him as he held it in his hands.
He brought the polo closer, his mind growing hazier as the musky scent became overpowering. His grip tightened, the soft fabric pulling him in, his fingers tracing the yellow details almost instinctively.
The room felt warmer now, the silence enveloping him like a blanket. Tyler‚Äôs resistance faded with each passing moment, the familiar scent and the feel of the polo overpowering his senses. It was as if the shirt itself was speaking to him, urging him to embrace the calm, the unity it promised.
As if in a trance, Tyler slowly slipped the polo over his head. The moment it touched his skin, he felt a strange peace settle over him, his thoughts quieting, his body relaxing as if it had found its purpose. The musky scent filled his lungs, grounding him, connecting him to something greater.
He looked down at himself, at the shiny black polo that now clung to his body. The yellow details gleamed in the dim light, and his fingers brushed over the fabric, feeling a sense of pride he couldn‚Äôt explain.
His mind was empty, his fear gone, replaced by the steady, calm focus he had seen in his brother, in Matt, and in Alex. He was no longer Tyler, the one who resisted. He was part of something bigger now, something that filled him with purpose.
As he stepped out of the locker room, his movements were calm, controlled, each step aligning with the rhythm of the voices that had once chased him. Now, he was one of them, ready to bring others into the fold.
The night felt different now. The world around Tyler was still, serene, as he walked back toward his house. The familiar streetlights cast a faint glow on the shiny black Fred Perry polo he now wore, its yellow accents catching the light in a way that felt almost otherworldly. Tyler moved with calm purpose, the faint, lingering musk from the locker room grounding him with each step.
When he reached the doorstep of his home, he paused, taking a slow breath as he felt a sense of clarity wash over him. Everything had fallen into place.
Inside, the house was quiet, the soft glow from a single lamp spilling into the hall. Tyler made his way toward the living room, where he found his brother, Luke, sitting calmly on the couch. Luke looked up, his gaze unwavering, his own polo a perfect match to Tyler‚Äôs.
‚ÄúWelcome home, Ty,‚Äù Luke said, his tone warm but calm, as if he had been waiting for this moment.
Tyler moved to sit beside his brother, feeling a strange sense of peace. The resistance, the confusion, all of it felt like a distant memory, replaced by the quiet purpose they now shared.
They sat in silence, basking in their newfound unity. After a few moments, Luke‚Äôs gaze drifted toward the hallway closet, and a faint smile tugged at his lips.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost complete now,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúCoach said there‚Äôs always room for more.‚Äù
Tyler‚Äôs gaze followed his brother‚Äôs, and there, nestled in the back of the closet, he noticed three neatly folded black polos, each one identical to theirs, the yellow accents gleaming softly under the light.
Their father‚Äôs voice sounded from upstairs, a hint of curiosity in his tone. ‚ÄúTyler? Luke? Is that you boys?‚Äù
Tyler and Luke exchanged a knowing look, their smiles widening ever so slightly. They both rose from the couch, moving with quiet, steady steps toward the hallway closet, each of them taking a polo from the pile.
The house was silent as they made their way up the stairs, their expressions calm, their purpose clear.
And as they disappeared into the shadows of the hallway, the last light in the house went out, leaving only the faint scent of musk lingering in the air.

### Maple Heights - Part 3: The Unity Center
It was well past midnight when Tyler and Luke received the message from Coach. The directive was clear, the instructions simple: Michael was ready to be brought into the fold, and Tyler and Luke were tasked with guiding him. The Unity Center was silent, its shadowed halls carrying only the faint hum of machinery as the brothers slipped quietly back home.
The house was dark, the soft ticking of a clock the only sound as they crept up the stairs toward Michael‚Äôs room. Luke‚Äôs expression was calm, his mind focused, while Tyler felt a small stir of hesitation. Michael was the youngest, the one they‚Äôd always looked out for. Yet, there was a certainty to their purpose tonight that pushed away any lingering doubts.
The door to Michael‚Äôs room creaked as they pushed it open, revealing the familiar surroundings. Posters lined the walls, and a faint nightlight cast a warm glow over the room. Michael lay fast asleep, his breathing steady, completely unaware of the presence now surrounding him.
Tyler glanced at Luke, who nodded in silent encouragement. They approached the bed, careful not to make a sound. Luke reached into his bag, pulling out a device‚Äîa spiral screen with a soft glow, designed to subtly draw Michael‚Äôs gaze and pull him into a state of calm obedience.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get him ready,‚Äù Luke whispered, his voice a steady murmur. They leaned close to Michael, gently moving his arm and adjusting his position so he lay with his head turned toward the spiral.
The spiral‚Äôs soft light filled the room as Tyler held it near Michael‚Äôs face, and gradually, a faint, rhythmic pulsing sound emanated from it. Michael‚Äôs breathing slowed, his eyelids fluttering as the glow caught his unconscious gaze. Even in sleep, his body responded, sinking deeper into the gentle trance radiating from the spiral.
Tyler felt a strange mix of protectiveness and satisfaction watching the process. This was his younger brother, someone he had always guided and protected. Now, he was bringing him into the unity they shared, ensuring he‚Äôd never have to struggle alone again.
The next step came easily. Luke pulled a small headset from the bag and carefully placed it over Michael‚Äôs ears, the faint, steady hum of Coach‚Äôs voice joining the spiral‚Äôs glow. Tyler watched as Michael‚Äôs expression softened, the tension melting from his face. The instructions whispered in his ears were calm, reassuring, sinking into his subconscious as he drifted deeper into the conditioning.
‚ÄúTonight, you are joining something greater,‚Äù Coach‚Äôs voice intoned through the headset. ‚ÄúTonight, you find clarity and strength in unity.‚Äù
Tyler and Luke moved silently, pulling the black polo from the bag and gently slipping it over Michael‚Äôs shoulders. As they adjusted the collar, the sight of him in the familiar black and yellow brought a sense of completion. Michael‚Äôs hand twitched slightly, but his breathing remained steady, the words from the headset guiding him deeper, reinforcing his loyalty.
As the final step, Luke held up the spiral device, setting it on the nightstand where its glow would remain through the night, casting a hypnotic pattern over Michael‚Äôs face. The pulsing light would continue until dawn, solidifying his place in the collective, ensuring he‚Äôd wake with a new clarity, a new purpose.
‚ÄúBy morning, he‚Äôll understand,‚Äù Luke murmured, his voice a calm reassurance.
Tyler nodded, watching as Michael‚Äôs hand relaxed against the sheet, his face peaceful in the soft glow. For the first time, he felt an undeniable sense of unity, knowing that all three of them would be together in this purpose. As they closed the door behind them, leaving Michael to his silent transformation, Tyler knew the family was one step closer to unity.
The next morning brought a quiet sense of satisfaction for Tyler and Luke. As they prepared for the day, the house felt unified, as if Michael‚Äôs transformation had completed something that had been missing. They could hear him moving around in his room, and both brothers exchanged a knowing look, confident that the spiral‚Äôs influence had taken hold.
But just as they finished breakfast, the doorbell rang. Tyler glanced at Luke, who raised an eyebrow. Neither had expected visitors. Let's get our masks.
Standing on the porch was Evan, Michael‚Äôs boyfriend. Evan looked relaxed and cheerful, clearly unaware of the night‚Äôs events. He grinned as Michael opened the door, greeting him with a warm hug.
‚ÄúYou ready to hit the mall?‚Äù Evan asked, his voice easygoing as he looked over at Tyler and Luke, offering a friendly nod. ‚ÄúHey guys! Hope I‚Äôm not intruding.‚Äù
Michael returned the smile, but there was a hint of something new in his demeanor‚Äîhis posture was straighter, his gaze more focused.
‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù Michael replied, his tone calm, almost a mirror of Tyler‚Äôs and Luke‚Äôs. ‚ÄúCome on in for a second. I just need to grab something.‚Äù
As Michael went to his room, Evan‚Äôs gaze followed him, a slight frown creasing his brow. He seemed to pick up on the subtle changes, looking back at Tyler and Luke with a curious expression.
Evan glanced at the matching black polos Tyler and Luke were wearing and then looked back at Michael, who had just returned with his own shirt carefully buttoned. ‚ÄúYou look... different,‚Äù Evan said, his tone playful but with a hint of uncertainty. ‚ÄúI mean, you always look good, but something feels‚Ä¶ new. Why the gas mask?‚Äù
Michael offered a slight smile, his voice steady. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm feeling more focused these days.‚Äù
Tyler and Luke exchanged a glance, sensing Evan‚Äôs hesitation. They knew Coach‚Äôs influence was subtle, but it wouldn‚Äôt be long before Evan noticed the depth of Michael‚Äôs transformation. Michael seemed almost indifferent to Evan‚Äôs concern, as if his attention had already shifted to the shared unity.
‚ÄúYou guys want to join us?‚Äù Evan asked, looking between the brothers with a friendly, if cautious, smile.
Luke shook his head. ‚ÄúWe have other plans,‚Äù he replied smoothly, his gaze resting on Michael for a moment. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm sure you two will have a good time. Just remember, Mike‚Ä¶ stay focused.‚Äù
Michael gave a slight nod, a small smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I am.‚Äù
As they left, Tyler and Luke watched from the window, noting the changes in Michael‚Äôs body language. His movements were more measured, his tone more reserved. Evan seemed to notice, too, trying to engage Michael in light conversation on their way to the car.
At the mall, Evan kept glancing at Michael, picking up on the subtle differences in his responses. Michael was calmer, more deliberate, his attention never wandering. Finally, Evan decided to address it.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting kind of different today, Mike. Is everything okay?‚Äù
Michael looked at him, his expression unreadable. ‚ÄúYeah, just‚Ä¶ focused. Things are clearer now, you know?‚Äù
Evan frowned. ‚ÄúClearer? What do you mean?‚Äù
Michael turned to him with a calm but firm gaze, the same quiet authority Tyler and Luke had gained. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt explain it, Evan, but it‚Äôs something you‚Äôd understand if you felt it too.‚Äù
Evan‚Äôs confusion deepened, and for the rest of the day, he couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that Michael was hiding something‚Äîsomething important. And as the afternoon wore on, Michael‚Äôs subtle encouragement became clear, his words tinged with an invitation.
‚ÄúMaybe you should come with me to the Unity Center sometime,‚Äù Michael said at one point, his voice a gentle suggestion but his gaze steady. ‚ÄúIt might help you understand what I mean.‚Äù At the Unity Center were two guards always guarding the door:
Evan‚Äôs reluctance was palpable, but Michael‚Äôs calm persistence left a subtle, lingering influence. And though he didn‚Äôt realize it yet, something about Michael‚Äôs newfound focus would keep Evan curious, drawing him closer to the truth in the days to come.
Evan felt a strange mix of curiosity and unease as he entered the Unity Center with Michael. The grand space exuded a quiet power, its rows of pews filled with men dressed in identical glossy black polos, faces blank with serene focus. The stained glass windows filtered dim light, casting dark, shifting patterns on the walls, while the steady chanting of a male choir filled the air with an eerie cadence.
As Evan and Michael moved down the aisle, Evan noticed that all the men wore the same expression of calm obedience. Even the choir members, who stood near the altar, seemed almost mechanical in their singing, their eyes fixed on the spiral symbol at the front of the room.
But it was when Coach entered that the room truly fell silent. He stepped forward with an air of complete control, followed by five men, each dressed in identical polos, who flanked him like sentinels. They were Coach‚Äôs chosen helpers, his inner circle, expressions as still and calm as the men seated around the room.
As Evan‚Äôs gaze swept over the room, his attention snagged on one of the helpers standing beside Coach. His stomach dropped as he recognized the face‚ÄîMr. Archer, his father, now dressed in the same rubbery, shiny black Fred Perry polo as the others. His father‚Äôs face was devoid of the warmth Evan remembered, replaced with a calm, obedient expression, his gaze firmly fixed on Coach, awaiting orders.
Michael placed a reassuring hand on Evan‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúYour father understands now, Evan. He‚Äôs found clarity.‚Äù
Evan‚Äôs heart raced as he tried to reconcile the image of his father as a follower, his once-independent mind now obedient to Coach‚Äôs commands.
‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶‚Äù Evan whispered, taking a step forward.
But Mr. Archer didn‚Äôt respond, his gaze remaining fixed on Coach. The lack of recognition in his father‚Äôs eyes felt like a punch to Evan‚Äôs gut. He tried to move toward him, but Michael‚Äôs grip on his shoulder tightened, guiding him back into his place in the pew.
‚ÄúCoach will explain,‚Äù Michael murmured, his voice calm yet firm.
Coach raised a hand, silencing the choir as he began to speak. His voice was steady, commanding, filling the space with an unsettling authority.
‚ÄúTonight, we welcome another into our brotherhood,‚Äù he announced, his gaze resting on Evan. ‚ÄúUnity is not forced; it is embraced. We invite you, Evan, to feel the peace that comes with surrender, just as those before you have done.‚Äù
Coach gestured toward his loyal helpers, each standing with perfect posture, faces set in unwavering obedience. Evan‚Äôs father stood among them, his expression as neutral and focused as the rest.
‚ÄúYou see, Evan, even your father has joined our purpose. It was only once he let go of his resistance that he understood the strength of unity.‚Äù
The choir resumed their chanting, the words blending seamlessly with Coach‚Äôs voice. Evan felt his body respond, a strange sense of calm attempting to override his shock and fear.
Two of Coach‚Äôs helpers moved forward, approaching Evan with calm precision. Michael stayed close, his hand steady on Evan‚Äôs shoulder as he guided him to a side room, leaving the chanting choir and the quiet pews behind.
In the dimly lit room, Evan noticed several empty pods lined up against the walls. Each pod was designed to fit a single person, with a helmet above and straps along the arms and legs, clearly built for compliance. The sight of the pods made Evan‚Äôs heart race, but Michael‚Äôs calm voice eased him back into place.
‚ÄúEveryone here has gone through this,‚Äù Michael explained, his voice a gentle reassurance. ‚ÄúYour father, me, Tyler‚Äîall of us found our place by letting go.‚Äù
Before he could respond, Evan felt the steady hands of Coach‚Äôs helpers guiding him into one of the pods. His arms and legs were gently strapped down, securing him in place as he tried to take in the reality of his situation. The helpers moved with quiet efficiency, their faces calm, unfazed by his unease.
Above him, the helmet descended, blocking his view of the room. Only the soft chanting of the choir filtered through, its steady cadence lulling him into a state of calm.
The visor of the helmet flickered to life, displaying the familiar spiral that had been subtly present in the Unity Center‚Äôs architecture and decor. The spiral filled his vision, pulsing softly, its hypnotic movement pulling him deeper into focus. Each rotation seemed to whisper to him, reinforcing words of unity, obedience, and surrender.
As the spiral continued its hypnotic dance, a gas mask descended over his face, sealing gently around his mouth and nose. The faint smell of calming gas filled the mask, and Evan felt his body relax as he breathed in the tranquilizing scent, each inhalation easing his resistance bit by bit.
Coach‚Äôs voice filtered through the helmet‚Äôs speakers, low and commanding. ‚ÄúWelcome to unity, Evan. Breathe in the calm, let go of the noise. Here, you are safe, and here, you belong.‚Äù
The gas filled his lungs, the spiral continuing its relentless pull on his mind, and his thoughts grew fuzzy, his will slipping away under the layers of influence surrounding him.
When the helmet and mask lifted, Evan blinked, his mind a quiet expanse, his previous doubts and resistance completely erased. He rose from the pod, standing tall, his expression calm and unwavering. His father and the other helpers welcomed him with approving nods, their gazes filled with a quiet pride.
Coach stepped forward, placing a hand on Evan‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúYou understand now, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù
Evan nodded, his mind filled only with clarity and purpose. He joined Michael, Tyler, and his father, the four of them now standing together as a unified force, each one obedient to Coach‚Äôs will.
As they returned to the hall, the male-only choir resumed their chant, a low, haunting sound that reverberated through the Unity Center, binding each member in a silent pledge of loyalty. Evan‚Äôs gaze met his father‚Äôs, both sharing a look of mutual understanding‚Äîany trace of their previous identities had faded, replaced by their shared purpose within the Unity Center‚Äôs ever-growing collective.
Now it was time for the three brothers to head home, have a 'talk' with their fathers...

### Changes: Maple Heights - Part 3: The Unity Center
It was well past midnight when Tyler and Luke received the message from Coach. The directive was clear, the instructions simple: Michael was ready to be brought into the fold, and Tyler and Luke were tasked with guiding him. The Unity Center was silent, its shadowed halls carrying only the faint hum of machinery as the brothers slipped quietly back home.
The house was dark, the soft ticking of a clock the only sound as they crept up the stairs toward Michael‚Äôs room. Luke‚Äôs expression was calm, his mind focused, while Tyler felt a small stir of hesitation. Michael was the youngest, the one they‚Äôd always looked out for.

Tyler glanced at Luke, who nodded in silent encouragement. They approached the bed, careful not to make a sound. Luke reached into his bag, pulling out a device‚Äîa spiral screen with a soft glow, designed to subtly draw Michael‚Äôs gaze and pull him into a state of calm obedience.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get him ready,‚Äù Luke whispered, his voice a steady murmur. They leaned close to Michael, gently moving his arm and adjusting his position so he lay with his head turned toward the spiral.
The spiral‚Äôs soft light filled the room as Tyler held it near Michael‚Äôs face, and gradually, a faint, rhythmic pulsing sound emanated from it. Michael‚Äôs breathing slowed, his eyelids fluttering as the glow caught his unconscious gaze. Even in sleep, his body responded, sinking deeper into the gentle trance radiating from the spiral.
Tyler felt a strange mix of protectiveness and satisfaction watching the process. This was his younger brother, someone he had always guided and protected. Now, he was bringing him into the unity they shared, ensuring he‚Äôd never have to struggle alone again.
The next step came easily. Luke pulled a small headset from the bag and carefully placed it over Michael‚Äôs ears, the faint, steady hum of Coach‚Äôs voice joining the spiral‚Äôs glow. Tyler watched as Michael‚Äôs expression softened, the tension melting from his face. The instructions whispered in his ears were calm, reassuring, sinking into his subconscious as he drifted deeper into the conditioning.
‚ÄúTonight, you are joining something greater,‚Äù Coach‚Äôs voice intoned through the headset. ‚ÄúTonight, you find clarity and strength in unity.‚Äù
Tyler and Luke moved silently, pulling the black polo from the bag and gently slipping it over Michael‚Äôs shoulders. As they adjusted the collar, the sight of him in the familiar black and yellow brought a sense of completion. Michael‚Äôs hand twitched slightly, but his breathing remained steady, the words from the headset guiding him deeper, reinforcing his loyalty.
As the final step, Luke held up the spiral device, setting it on the nightstand where its glow would remain through the night, casting a hypnotic pattern over Michael‚Äôs face. The pulsing light would continue until dawn, solidifying his place in the collective, ensuring he‚Äôd wake with a new clarity, a new purpose.
‚ÄúBy morning, he‚Äôll understand,‚Äù Luke murmured, his voice a calm reassurance.
Tyler nodded, watching as Michael‚Äôs hand relaxed against the sheet, his face peaceful in the soft glow. For the first time, he felt an undeniable sense of unity, knowing that all three of them would be together in this purpose. As they closed the door behind them, leaving Michael to his silent transformation, Tyler knew the family was one step closer to unity.
The next morning brought a quiet sense of satisfaction for Tyler and Luke.

Standing on the porch was Evan, Michael‚Äôs boyfriend. Evan looked relaxed and cheerful, clearly unaware of the night‚Äôs events. He grinned as Michael opened the door, greeting him with a warm hug.
‚ÄúYou ready to hit the mall?‚Äù Evan asked, his voice easygoing as he looked over at Tyler and Luke, offering a friendly nod. ‚ÄúHey guys! Hope I‚Äôm not intruding.‚Äù
Michael returned the smile, but there was a hint of something new in his demeanor‚Äîhis posture was straighter, his gaze more focused.
‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù Michael replied, his tone calm, almost a mirror of Tyler‚Äôs and Luke‚Äôs. ‚ÄúCome on in for a second. I just need to grab something.‚Äù
As Michael went to his room, Evan‚Äôs gaze followed him, a slight frown creasing his brow. He seemed to pick up on the subtle changes, looking back at Tyler and Luke with a curious expression.
Evan glanced at the matching black polos Tyler and Luke were wearing and then looked back at Michael, who had just returned with his own shirt carefully buttoned. ‚ÄúYou look... different,‚Äù Evan said, his tone playful but with a hint of uncertainty. ‚ÄúI mean, you always look good, but something feels‚Ä¶ new. Why the gas mask?‚Äù
Michael offered a slight smile, his voice steady. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm feeling more focused these days.‚Äù
Tyler and Luke exchanged a glance, sensing Evan‚Äôs hesitation. They knew Coach‚Äôs influence was subtle, but it wouldn‚Äôt be long before Evan noticed the depth of Michael‚Äôs transformation. Michael seemed almost indifferent to Evan‚Äôs concern, as if his attention had already shifted to the shared unity.
‚ÄúYou guys want to join us?‚Äù Evan asked, looking between the brothers with a friendly, if cautious, smile.
Luke shook his head. ‚ÄúWe have other plans,‚Äù he replied smoothly, his gaze resting on Michael for a moment. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm sure you two will have a good time. Just remember, Mike‚Ä¶ stay focused.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting kind of different today, Mike. Is everything okay?‚Äù
Michael looked at him, his expression unreadable. ‚ÄúYeah, just‚Ä¶ focused. Things are clearer now, you know?‚Äù
Evan frowned. ‚ÄúClearer? What do you mean?‚Äù
Michael turned to him with a calm but firm gaze, the same quiet authority Tyler and Luke had gained. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt explain it, Evan, but it‚Äôs something you‚Äôd understand if you felt it too.‚Äù
Evan‚Äôs confusion deepened, and for the rest of the day, he couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that Michael was hiding something‚Äîsomething important. And as the afternoon wore on, Michael‚Äôs subtle encouragement became clear, his words tinged with an invitation.
‚ÄúMaybe you should come with me to the Unity Center sometime,‚Äù Michael said at one point, his voice a gentle suggestion but his gaze steady. ‚ÄúIt might help you understand what I mean.‚Äù At the Unity Center were two guards always guarding the door:

Michael placed a reassuring hand on Evan‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúYour father understands now, Evan. He‚Äôs found clarity.‚Äù
Evan‚Äôs heart raced as he tried to reconcile the image of his father as a follower, his once-independent mind now obedient to Coach‚Äôs commands.
‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶‚Äù Evan whispered, taking a step forward.
But Mr. Archer didn‚Äôt respond, his gaze remaining fixed on Coach. The lack of recognition in his father‚Äôs eyes felt like a punch to Evan‚Äôs gut. He tried to move toward him, but Michael‚Äôs grip on his shoulder tightened, guiding him back into his place in the pew.
‚ÄúCoach will explain,‚Äù Michael murmured, his voice calm yet firm.
Coach raised a hand, silencing the choir as he began to speak. His voice was steady, commanding, filling the space with an unsettling authority.
‚ÄúTonight, we welcome another into our brotherhood,‚Äù he announced, his gaze resting on Evan. ‚ÄúUnity is not forced; it is embraced. We invite you, Evan, to feel the peace that comes with surrender, just as those before you have done.‚Äù
Coach gestured toward his loyal helpers, each standing with perfect posture, faces set in unwavering obedience. Evan‚Äôs father stood among them, his expression as neutral and focused as the rest.
‚ÄúYou see, Evan, even your father has joined our purpose. It was only once he let go of his resistance that he understood the strength of unity.‚Äù
The choir resumed their chanting, the words blending seamlessly with Coach‚Äôs voice. Evan felt his body respond, a strange sense of calm attempting to override his shock and fear.
Two of Coach‚Äôs helpers moved forward, approaching Evan with calm precision. Michael stayed close, his hand steady on Evan‚Äôs shoulder as he guided him to a side room, leaving the chanting choir and the quiet pews behind.
In the dimly lit room, Evan noticed several empty pods lined up against the walls. Each pod was designed to fit a single person, with a helmet above and straps along the arms and legs, clearly built for compliance. The sight of the pods made Evan‚Äôs heart race, but Michael‚Äôs calm voice eased him back into place.
‚ÄúEveryone here has gone through this,‚Äù Michael explained, his voice a gentle reassurance. ‚ÄúYour father, me, Tyler‚Äîall of us found our place by letting go.‚Äù
Before he could respond, Evan felt the steady hands of Coach‚Äôs helpers guiding him into one of the pods. His arms and legs were gently strapped down, securing him in place as he tried to take in the reality of his situation. The helpers moved with quiet efficiency, their faces calm, unfazed by his unease.
Above him, the helmet descended, blocking his view of the room. Only the soft chanting of the choir filtered through, its steady cadence lulling him into a state of calm.
The visor of the helmet flickered to life, displaying the familiar spiral that had been subtly present in the Unity Center‚Äôs architecture and decor. The spiral filled his vision, pulsing softly, its hypnotic movement pulling him deeper into focus. Each rotation seemed to whisper to him, reinforcing words of unity, obedience, and surrender.
As the spiral continued its hypnotic dance, a gas mask descended over his face, sealing gently around his mouth and nose. The faint smell of calming gas filled the mask, and Evan felt his body relax as he breathed in the tranquilizing scent, each inhalation easing his resistance bit by bit.
Coach‚Äôs voice filtered through the helmet‚Äôs speakers, low and commanding. ‚ÄúWelcome to unity, Evan. Breathe in the calm, let go of the noise. Here, you are safe, and here, you belong.‚Äù
The gas filled his lungs, the spiral continuing its relentless pull on his mind, and his thoughts grew fuzzy, his will slipping away under the layers of influence surrounding him.
When the helmet and mask lifted, Evan blinked, his mind a quiet expanse, his previous doubts and resistance completely erased. He rose from the pod, standing tall, his expression calm and unwavering. His father and the other helpers welcomed him with approving nods, their gazes filled with a quiet pride.
Coach stepped forward, placing a hand on Evan‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúYou understand now, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù
Evan nodded, his mind filled only with clarity and purpose. He joined Michael, Tyler, and his father, the four of them now standing together as a unified force, each one obedient to Coach‚Äôs will.
As they returned to the hall, the male-only choir resumed their chant, a low, haunting sound that reverberated through the Unity Center, binding each member in a silent pledge of loyalty. Evan‚Äôs gaze met his father‚Äôs, both sharing a look of mutual understanding‚Äîany trace of their previous identities had faded, replaced by their shared purpose within the Unity Center‚Äôs ever-growing collective.
Now it was time for the three brothers to head home, have a 'talk' with their fathers...

### Maple Heights - Part 4: No Escape
The door to the house creaked open as Tyler, Luke, and Michael stepped into the entryway, their black polos with yellow details catching the dim glow of the hallway lights. Their faces were obscured by gas masks, each breath producing a soft, eerie muffling sound as they repeated their chant in unison: ‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶ join us‚Ä¶‚Äù
Their fathers, Greg and Paul, stood at the far end of the hall, shocked to see their own sons transformed. Greg‚Äôs face was tight with fear, and Paul‚Äôs eyes were wide with disbelief as they watched the slow, methodical advance of their three sons.
‚ÄúMichael, Luke, Tyler‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs happened to you?‚Äù Greg whispered, his voice filled with desperation. But his words seemed to bounce off them, ignored as the brothers continued forward, their voices calm and hypnotic.
‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶‚Äù Tyler intoned softly through his mask, each word muffled but filled with purpose.
Realizing the danger, Paul grabbed Greg‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúWe have to get out of here!‚Äù Without waiting, they turned and sprinted down the hallway, heading for the back door.
As they reached it, Greg threw it open, only to be confronted by two other figures standing in the doorway‚Äîtwo young man in glossy black Fred Perry polo with yellow details, their faces hidden behind the same cold visor. His posture was still, his expression blank as he blocked their way.
‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶‚Äù the figure intoned, echoing the chant of the brothers.
Greg shut the door, his heart racing. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre everywhere,‚Äù he whispered in shock. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre all in on it.‚Äù
‚ÄúUpstairs,‚Äù Paul urged, steering his brother toward the staircase. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find a way out through the bedroom windows.‚Äù
The two fathers dashed up the stairs, the rhythmic chanting of ‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶ join us‚Ä¶‚Äù following them up, a haunting echo that filled every corner of the house. Tyler, Luke, and Michael advanced at a steady, controlled pace, the soft glow of their masks casting eerie shadows as they moved.
Once they reached the top floor, Paul and Greg ran into the nearest bedroom and locked the door. They shared a terrified glance, their breaths heavy and rapid.
‚ÄúWhy are they doing this?‚Äù Greg murmured, his voice filled with fear. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre acting like‚Ä¶ like they‚Äôre not even our sons anymore.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhatever‚Äôs happened to them, we need to get out of here,‚Äù Paul replied. He moved to the window, glancing down to make sure the coast was clear. Seeing no figures below, he opened it. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go. Climb down, and we‚Äôll run to Daniel‚Äôs place.‚Äù
One by one, they lowered themselves out of the window, dropping to the ground below. Without another word, they sprinted across the lawn and down the street, aiming for Daniel‚Äôs house, hoping for a safe haven.
The rhythmic chant of ‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶‚Äù echoed faintly in the distance, growing louder with each step, as if the entire neighborhood was filled with the same hypnotic call.
They reached Daniel‚Äôs house, breathless, and pounded on the door. Within moments, it opened, revealing Daniel standing in his pajamas, his face filled with confusion and concern.
‚ÄúPaul? Greg? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Daniel asked, his eyes flicking between the two men, noticing their terrified expressions.
‚ÄúLet us in, quickly!‚Äù Paul gasped, pulling Daniel inside and locking the door behind them. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the boys. They‚Äôve changed. They‚Äôre not‚Ä¶ themselves anymore.‚Äù
Daniel‚Äôs brow furrowed. ‚ÄúChanged? What do you mean?‚Äù
Before they could explain, there was a loud knock at the door, and the chilling chant of ‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶ join us‚Ä¶‚Äù echoed through the walls. Daniel‚Äôs face paled as he looked toward the door, his expression shifting to one of horror.
‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what is that?‚Äù he whispered, backing away from the door.
The door creaked open, revealing the three brothers standing in the doorway, their faces calm and expressionless behind their visors, their black polos shining under the dim lights. They stepped inside, their movements slow and deliberate, their voices blending into a single, rhythmic chant as they advanced.
‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶ join us‚Ä¶‚Äù
Paul and Greg backed into the corner, their eyes wide with fear. But Daniel, unable to comprehend what was happening, took a step forward, trying to reason with them. ‚ÄúTyler, Luke, Michael, stop this. Whatever‚Äôs going on, you don‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù
But his words fell on deaf ears. The brothers moved forward, their hands reaching out as they surrounded Daniel. Tyler placed a firm hand on Daniel‚Äôs shoulder, and Michael pressed down on his other side, guiding him with calm precision.
‚ÄúJoin us,‚Äù they intoned softly, their voices a quiet command that seemed to slip past Daniel‚Äôs defenses.
Paul and Greg watched in horror as their brother, Daniel, began to sway under the influence of the chant. His face went blank, his eyes unfocused as the brothers guided him to his knees. They removed a sleek black visor from a pouch, slowly lowering it over Daniel‚Äôs eyes. The visor clicked into place, and with it, Daniel‚Äôs face shifted, adopting the same calm, distant expression as his nephews.
As the visor clicked into place over Daniel's eyes, a low, distorted hum filled his ears, followed by a voice‚Äîsoft yet chillingly mechanical, each word dripping with a hypnotic pull.
"You are slipping now‚Ä¶ sinking deeper‚Ä¶ falling away from who you were‚Ä¶You will be robotized."
The words pulsed, each phrase drawing Daniel further into a fog, erasing his thoughts one by one. His mind, which had been teetering on the edge of resistance, now felt heavy, sinking into an eerie calm that spread like a warm haze.
"Your mind is quiet‚Ä¶ empty‚Ä¶ ready to obey," the voice continued, each word slowly unraveling his sense of self. "You do not need to think‚Ä¶ thinking is tiring‚Ä¶ thinking is gone."
Daniel‚Äôs thoughts faded into a dull, distant echo as the words took over, filling every corner of his mind with a blissful, mindless calm.
"You wear the polo now‚Ä¶ proud and obedient," the voice droned, each syllable sinking into him like weights, locking him into this newfound purpose. "Let go‚Ä¶ obey‚Ä¶ there is nothing else."
A faint, faraway part of him realized his lips were parting into a slow, empty smile. The visor's faint glow pulsed with the words, sinking him deeper into this obedient haze, each beat aligning with his heart, binding him further.
"You are a vessel now‚Ä¶ ready to serve‚Ä¶ ready to be led."
The voice softened, but its pull grew stronger, each word seeping into him like a command he could no longer resist. He swayed slightly, feeling himself submit to the numbing warmth that spread through him. He was sinking, deeper and deeper, his mind dissolving into a comfortable, obedient fog.
"There is no you," the voice whispered, barely audible but all-consuming. "Only the command‚Ä¶ only the uniform‚Ä¶ wear it proud‚Ä¶ think no more."
With those final words, Daniel‚Äôs thoughts fell silent, replaced by a serene, mindless obedience. His smile grew, calm and blank, as he sank fully into his new, obedient role.
‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no, Daniel!‚Äù Greg shouted, rushing forward in a desperate attempt to save his brother. But before he could reach him, another figure stepped into view‚ÄîDaniel‚Äôs son, Alex, who had come downstairs, alerted by the commotion.
Alex‚Äôs face was a mask of horror as he saw his father‚Äôs transformation. ‚ÄúDad? What‚Ä¶ what are they doing to you?‚Äù he asked, voice trembling.
Without hesitation, he moved toward his father, trying to pull the visor off. But Luke and Michael‚Äôs grip was firm, holding Daniel in place as he sank further under their control.
‚ÄúAlex, stay back!‚Äù Paul warned, his voice thick with fear. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll get you too!‚Äù
But Alex shook his head, his focus locked on his father. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just watch this!‚Äù He grabbed at the visor, trying to pull it free, but Tyler placed a firm hand on Alex‚Äôs shoulder, stopping him.
‚ÄúJoin us,‚Äù Tyler murmured, his voice muffled but clear.
The phrase seemed to sink into Alex‚Äôs mind, his struggle weakening as the words repeated around him, filling the air with their quiet, relentless command. His gaze grew unfocused, his resistance fading as he looked up at his cousins, his hands slowly dropping to his sides.
The brothers lowered another visor over Alex‚Äôs face, securing it with the same calm, precise movements. As the visor clicked into place, Alex‚Äôs face went blank, mirroring the serene, obedient expression of his father.
Paul and Greg stood paralyzed, horror filling their eyes as they watched both Daniel and Alex succumb, their family slipping away into the collective, one by one. The rhythmic chant of ‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶ join us‚Ä¶‚Äù filled the house, leaving no room for resistance, no space for escape.
Realizing the hopelessness of their situation, Paul and Greg took a step back, their backs pressed against the wall as they waited for the inevitable, the chant echoing in their minds, beckoning them to surrender.
‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶‚Äù
The hallway felt smaller with every step the fathers took. Greg and Paul found themselves backed against the cold, unyielding wall as Tyler, Luke, and Michael advanced, their calm, rhythmic chant echoing off the brick.
‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶ join us‚Ä¶‚Äù
Paul, heart pounding, glanced desperately at Greg. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stay here. We have to keep moving.‚Äù
But before they could make a move, Tyler and Luke each took hold of their arms, their grips firm yet unnervingly calm. Michael stood behind, blocking any chance of escape. Greg struggled against Tyler‚Äôs grip, but it was as though his son‚Äôs strength had multiplied, each movement deliberate and unbreakable.
‚ÄúRelease us!‚Äù Greg shouted, twisting his arm, but Tyler‚Äôs grasp only tightened as his muffled voice repeated, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to join us.‚Äù
With synchronized movements, the three brothers guided their fathers out of the house and down the street, their steady march matching the robotic precision of their chants. As they moved, more figures dressed in identical black polos joined the procession, each one silent and masked, creating an unsettling parade through the darkened neighborhood.
The farther they walked, the more Greg and Paul‚Äôs surroundings became unfamiliar. They were led through side streets and narrow alleys until they approached the industrial edge of town. There, parked behind a row of abandoned warehouses, loomed a large, dark vehicle‚Äîa bus with metallic black paint, its windows heavily tinted. The quiet hum of machinery pulsed from within, a faint red glow emanating from its interior, hinting at the ominous purpose that awaited inside.
‚ÄúWhere are you taking us?‚Äù Paul demanded, trying to pull free, but Luke‚Äôs grip was unyielding, his face expressionless beneath the visor.
‚ÄúTo the ship,‚Äù Michael replied in a soft, detached voice. ‚ÄúThere, you will understand. You will become part of the unity.‚Äù
As they approached the bus, a side door slid open, revealing rows of seats filled with other familiar faces from the neighborhood‚Äîall men, all silent, their faces blank beneath the visors that covered their eyes. They sat motionless, each dressed in the same glossy black Fred Perry polos with yellow details, the rubbery sheen reflecting the red glow from within.
The brothers guided Greg and Paul into the bus, securing them in seats near the front. Their movements were slow, methodical, as though they had rehearsed this many times before. Once seated, Greg tried to look around, recognizing faces among the other captives‚Äîmen who, like him, had once been fathers, brothers, friends. Now, they sat in perfect stillness, their minds apparently lost to whatever force had taken control of them.
‚ÄúStay still,‚Äù Tyler murmured through his mask, fastening a metallic band across Greg‚Äôs chest, securing him to the seat.
Paul struggled as Luke did the same, but his movements were weak and ineffective against the relentless, calm efficiency of his son‚Äôs grip. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this,‚Äù Paul pleaded, his voice filled with desperation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre our sons. You don‚Äôt have to‚Äî‚Äù
But Michael‚Äôs voice cut through his words, calm and unfeeling. ‚ÄúWe have found purpose. Soon, you will too.‚Äù
Once Greg and Paul were secured, the brothers took their seats near the front, each donning visors that matched those of the drones on board. The door slid shut with a soft hiss, and the bus hummed to life, beginning its journey to the ‚Äúship‚Äù that loomed on the outskirts of town.
After what felt like an eternity, the bus finally pulled to a stop at a fenced lot near the edge of an industrial complex. The entire area was illuminated by harsh floodlights, casting long shadows across the open ground. At the center stood a massive, ominous structure‚Äîa large, metallic building, shaped almost like an angular, grounded spacecraft. The air around it hummed faintly, as if powered by an unseen force.
One by one, the drones on the bus rose from their seats, filing out in a controlled, robotic procession. As Greg and Paul were released from their restraints, they were herded down the aisle by the brothers, who guided them toward the entrance of the ship.
Inside, the walls were lined with rows of small, windowless chambers, each one barely large enough to contain a single person. Through the open doors, Greg could see other captives standing inside the chambers, visors lowered over their eyes, their bodies held in place by metallic restraints that glowed faintly with red light.
Greg and Paul exchanged a desperate look, a silent plea passing between them as they realized the fate that awaited them.
‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù Greg whispered, turning to Tyler. ‚ÄúWhatever this is, you don‚Äôt have to go through with it. Fight it. Break free.‚Äù
But Tyler only looked at him, his gaze calm and detached. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late for that. Soon, you‚Äôll see.‚Äù
Michael and Luke guided them into neighboring chambers, the doors sliding shut with a quiet hiss. A faint light filled the room, and Greg felt his arms restrained by unseen forces as a metallic band closed around his forehead, holding his head in place. His pulse quickened as he watched a visor lower from the ceiling, moving slowly until it aligned with his eyes.
‚ÄúNo, no‚Äîplease, not this,‚Äù Greg murmured, struggling against the restraints. But as the visor clicked into place, his vision filled with a pulsing spiral, yellow and black hues spinning in mesmerizing patterns. He felt his mind growing calm, his body relaxing despite his attempts to resist.
‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶ join us‚Ä¶‚Äù came the faint chant through the speakers, the words slipping past his defenses and filling his thoughts, overriding everything else. His eyelids felt heavy, his mind clouded, and slowly, his resistance melted away.
In the neighboring chamber, Paul‚Äôs experience was no different. He felt the visor lowering over his face, his heart pounding as the spiral filled his vision. The rhythmic chant echoed in his ears, lulling him into a quiet trance as his thoughts faded, replaced by a calm, obedient clarity.
As the visor‚Äôs spiral pulsed, Paul‚Äôs expression softened, his breathing steadying as he surrendered to the influence surrounding him.
When the doors finally slid open, Greg and Paul stepped out of their chambers, their faces calm and blank, visors reflecting the red glow of the ship‚Äôs lights. Their glossy black polos with yellow details glistened as they joined the other drones, filing into a perfect line beside their transformed sons.
Tyler, Luke, and Michael watched with satisfaction as their fathers took their places, their postures straight, their expressions serene and obedient.
‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù Michael murmured, his voice calm and mechanical. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre part of us now.‚Äù
In perfect unison, Greg and Paul replied, ‚ÄúWe are one.‚Äù Their voices were calm and steady, as if they had known their purpose all along.
The transformed family joined the ranks of drones, marching in synchronized steps as the ship‚Äôs door closed behind them. The hum of machinery grew louder as the ship prepared to embark on its next mission, expanding the reach of the collective to every corner of Maple Heights.
And as they moved forward, one chant united them all, an unbreakable bond shared by every drone:
‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶ join us‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúTo the ship,‚Äù Michael replied in a soft, detached voice. ‚ÄúThere, you will understand. You will become part of the unity.‚Äù
As they approached the bus, a side door slid open, revealing rows of seats filled with other familiar faces from the neighborhood‚Äîall men, all silent, their faces blank beneath the visors that covered their eyes. They sat motionless, each dressed in the same glossy black Fred Perry polos with yellow details, the rubbery sheen reflecting the red glow from within.
The brothers guided Greg and Paul into the bus, securing them in seats near the front. Their movements were slow, methodical, as though they had rehearsed this many times before. Once seated, Greg tried to look around, recognizing faces among the other captives‚Äîmen who, like him, had once been fathers, brothers, friends. Now, they sat in perfect stillness, their minds apparently lost to whatever force had taken control of them.
‚ÄúStay still,‚Äù Tyler murmured through his mask, fastening a metallic band across Greg‚Äôs chest, securing him to the seat.
Paul struggled as Luke did the same, but his movements were weak and ineffective against the relentless, calm efficiency of his son‚Äôs grip. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this,‚Äù Paul pleaded, his voice filled with desperation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre our sons. You don‚Äôt have to‚Äî‚Äù
But Michael‚Äôs voice cut through his words, calm and unfeeling. ‚ÄúWe have found purpose. Soon, you will too.‚Äù
Once Greg and Paul were secured, the brothers took their seats near the front, each donning visors that matched those of the drones on board. The door slid shut with a soft hiss, and the bus hummed to life, beginning its journey to the ‚Äúship‚Äù that loomed on the outskirts of town.
After what felt like an eternity, the bus finally pulled to a stop at a fenced lot near the edge of an industrial complex. The entire area was illuminated by harsh floodlights, casting long shadows across the open ground. At the center stood a massive, ominous structure‚Äîa large, metallic building, shaped almost like an angular, grounded spacecraft. The air around it hummed faintly, as if powered by an unseen force.
One by one, the drones on the bus rose from their seats, filing out in a controlled, robotic procession. As Greg and Paul were released from their restraints, they were herded down the aisle by the brothers, who guided them toward the entrance of the ship.
Inside, the walls were lined with rows of small, windowless chambers, each one barely large enough to contain a single person. Through the open doors, Greg could see other captives standing inside the chambers, visors lowered over their eyes, their bodies held in place by metallic restraints that glowed faintly with red light.
Greg and Paul exchanged a desperate look, a silent plea passing between them as they realized the fate that awaited them.
‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù Greg whispered, turning to Tyler. ‚ÄúWhatever this is, you don‚Äôt have to go through with it. Fight it. Break free.‚Äù
But Tyler only looked at him, his gaze calm and detached. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late for that. Soon, you‚Äôll see.‚Äù
Michael and Luke guided them into neighboring chambers, the doors sliding shut with a quiet hiss. A faint light filled the room, and Greg felt his arms restrained by unseen forces as a metallic band closed around his forehead, holding his head in place. His pulse quickened as he watched a visor lower from the ceiling, moving slowly until it aligned with his eyes.
‚ÄúNo, no‚Äîplease, not this,‚Äù Greg murmured, struggling against the restraints. But as the visor clicked into place, his vision filled with a pulsing spiral, yellow and black hues spinning in mesmerizing patterns. He felt his mind growing calm, his body relaxing despite his attempts to resist.
‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶ join us‚Ä¶‚Äù came the faint chant through the speakers, the words slipping past his defenses and filling his thoughts, overriding everything else. His eyelids felt heavy, his mind clouded, and slowly, his resistance melted away.
In the neighboring chamber, Paul‚Äôs experience was no different. He felt the visor lowering over his face, his heart pounding as the spiral filled his vision. The rhythmic chant echoed in his ears, lulling him into a quiet trance as his thoughts faded, replaced by a calm, obedient clarity.
As the visor‚Äôs spiral pulsed, Paul‚Äôs expression softened, his breathing steadying as he surrendered to the influence surrounding him.
When the doors finally slid open, Greg and Paul stepped out of their chambers, their faces calm and blank, visors reflecting the red glow of the ship‚Äôs lights. Their glossy black polos with yellow details glistened as they joined the other drones, filing into a perfect line beside their transformed sons.
Tyler, Luke, and Michael watched with satisfaction as their fathers took their places, their postures straight, their expressions serene and obedient.
‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù Michael murmured, his voice calm and mechanical. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre part of us now.‚Äù
In perfect unison, Greg and Paul replied, ‚ÄúWe are one.‚Äù Their voices were calm and steady, as if they had known their purpose all along.
The transformed family joined the ranks of drones, marching in synchronized steps as the ship‚Äôs door closed behind them. The hum of machinery grew louder as the ship prepared to embark on its next mission, expanding the reach of the collective to every corner of Maple Heights.
And as they moved forward, one chant united them all, an unbreakable bond shared by every drone:
‚ÄúJoin us‚Ä¶ join us‚Ä¶‚Äù

### The Golden Arena
The Nova Knights had been at the bottom of the league for too long. Dylan, their top player, sat hunched over in the team‚Äôs practice room, nervously tapping his controller. He glanced over at his teammates, but they were unusually quiet. Mason, their sharpshooter, was scrolling through his phone, clearly agitated. Alex, the team‚Äôs strategist, sat across from him, staring blankly at his screen. Something felt wrong‚Äîdifferent.
The door opened, and Captain Richard walked in, his black suit crisp, his steps confident. The tension in the room was palpable as the players watched their new coach stride forward. His cold, calculating eyes scanned each player as if he already knew everything about them.
Without a word, Richard placed a large black duffel bag on the table and unzipped it. The contents shimmered, catching the room‚Äôs harsh fluorescent lights. Richard pulled out the golden AC Milan jerseys, one by one, the fabric glinting with a metallic sheen. Beneath each jersey was a crisp white button-up shirt and a red-and-black striped tie.
‚ÄúThese are your new uniforms,‚Äù Richard said in a low, commanding voice. ‚ÄúFrom now on, you‚Äôll wear them.‚Äù
Dylan felt a chill run down his spine. The jerseys looked heavy, far too formal for a gaming team. The white shirts and striped ties beneath the shiny metallic gold made the jerseys look more like military uniforms than sports kits.
Mason‚Äîalways the team‚Äôs jokester‚Äîlaughed nervously. ‚ÄúYou expect us to play in those? We‚Äôre gamers, not businessmen.‚Äù
Richard‚Äôs cold eyes locked onto Mason, and the room fell silent. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just gamers anymore. You‚Äôre soldiers in a war. And I‚Äôm going to make sure you win.‚Äù
One by one, the team reluctantly took the jerseys from Richard‚Äôs outstretched hand. Mason, now under Richard‚Äôs intense gaze, was the first to slip the jersey over his head. As soon as the fabric touched his skin, something shifted in his expression. His posture straightened, and his eyes widened slightly, almost as if he was in a trance.
The white button-up shirt was snug beneath the shimmering golden AC Milan jersey, and the red-and-black tie sat perfectly against Mason‚Äôs neck. Dylan watched, a growing sense of dread filling him as Mason‚Äîusually sarcastic and playful‚Äîbecame unnaturally quiet.
Alex followed suit, pulling the golden kit over his head. The transformation was subtle but unmistakable. His movements became more precise, his fingers twitching at his controller as though the jersey had injected him with new reflexes. His eyes, once sharp and always questioning, were now vacant.
Dylan hesitated. He could feel the pull of the jersey even before he put it on, like it had its own gravitational field. But what choice did he have? Reluctantly, he pulled the shiny metallic golden kit over his own white shirt and tie, feeling the strange warmth as it settled against his body.
As soon as the jersey was on, Dylan felt... different. His mind was sharper, his focus more intense. His body felt lighter, more responsive. But there was something else‚Äîsomething darker. It was as if the jersey was whispering to him, urging him to let go of his individuality and submit to the team.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll begin with practice,‚Äù Richard announced, turning to the team. ‚ÄúIn the new training room.‚Äù
Even Richard was wearing the new uniform:
Richard led the team down a narrow hallway to a door marked with a glowing golden emblem. Inside was something none of them had expected‚ÄîVR training rooms lined with sleek pods and massive screens displaying virtual battlefields. The hum of technology filled the room, and a strange electric buzz hung in the air.
‚ÄúThese VR pods will push you beyond your limits,‚Äù Richard explained as he led the players into the room. ‚ÄúThe golden jerseys are just the first step. In here, we‚Äôll refine you into something unstoppable.‚Äù
Mason‚Äînow called Chad‚Äîwas the first to step into one of the pods, pulling the golden helmet over his head. The helmet‚Äôs surface shimmered in the same metallic gold as the jerseys, and as soon as it was on, Chad‚Äôs eyes glazed over. His body relaxed completely, sinking into the seat of the pod.
The screen in front of Chad flickered to life, throwing him into an immersive VR battle. But it wasn‚Äôt just a game‚Äîinside the pod, the helmet and golden jersey began to pulse together, syncing his mind and body with the virtual world. Commands were fed directly into his subconscious, making him faster, more precise, and more obedient.
Dylan watched in horror as his teammates, one by one, stepped into the pods, slipping on the golden helmets without question. The way they moved‚Äîmechanical, emotionless‚Äîwasn‚Äôt just about training. They were being reprogrammed.
As the Nova Knights‚Äô performance skyrocketed, their success began drawing attention from sponsors and fans. People were curious‚Äîhow had this failing team suddenly become one of the best in the league?
Richard didn‚Äôt waste any time. At a post-tournament event, Richard moved through the crowd of sponsors, executives, and scouts with practiced ease. In his hand were small golden pins and wristbands, seemingly harmless gifts. One by one, he handed them out to those who approached him, his calm voice smooth and persuasive.
‚ÄúWear this, and you‚Äôll understand the future,‚Äù he would say to each sponsor, slipping a golden pin onto their jacket. At first, no one thought much of it. But once they wore the pins, something shifted. They found themselves drawn to the Nova Knights, attending practices, becoming more involved in the team‚Äôs affairs.
Soon, sponsors began to invest more, becoming increasingly obsessed with the team‚Äôs rise. Their minds weren‚Äôt their own anymore‚ÄîRichard had them under his control, and they didn‚Äôt even realize it. The influence of the golden jersey extended far beyond just the players.
Even friends...
Tyler and Evan had always been supportive of Dylan. They had been friends since high school, and though they didn‚Äôt share Dylan‚Äôs passion for gaming at a competitive level, they always cheered him on. When Dylan invited them to a major tournament match, they jumped at the chance to see him play live.
The arena was buzzing with excitement as the Nova Knights prepared for their next match. Tyler and Evan arrived early, making their way to the front row of seats, eager to support their friend. They waved at Dylan from the stands, but something about his expression seemed... off. He barely acknowledged them, his eyes focused elsewhere, his face tense.
‚ÄúDylan seems kinda out of it,‚Äù Tyler muttered as he watched his friend from afar.
‚ÄúYeah, maybe it‚Äôs nerves,‚Äù Evan replied, fidgeting with the Nova Knights cap he had just bought from the merchandise stand.
As they sat down, Richard‚Äôs presence loomed in the background, his cold eyes scanning the crowd. His gaze landed on Tyler and Evan, and a small, calculating smile crossed his lips.
After the match‚Äîwhere the Nova Knights dominated their opponents with unsettling precision‚ÄîRichard approached the two friends.
‚ÄúEnjoy the game, gentlemen?‚Äù Richard asked smoothly, his voice calm but commanding.
Tyler nodded, grinning. ‚ÄúYeah, man! Dylan‚Äôs team is looking unstoppable!‚Äù
Evan chimed in, ‚ÄúNever seen them play like that. Must be the new coach magic.‚Äù
Richard chuckled softly, but his eyes remained sharp. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than just coaching. There‚Äôs something special about this team. How would you like to get closer? Experience what it‚Äôs like to be part of something... bigger?‚Äù
The two friends exchanged confused glances, but the allure of being close to their friend‚Äîand the team‚Äôs meteoric rise‚Äîwas too strong to resist.
‚ÄúUh, yeah, sure. What do you mean?‚Äù Tyler asked.
Richard reached into his jacket and pulled out two golden jerseys, the shiny metallic AC Milan kits catching the arena lights. ‚ÄúYou could try these on. You‚Äôll feel it immediately.‚Äù
Evan laughed, not taking it seriously. ‚ÄúLike, just wear the jerseys?‚Äù
Richard nodded. ‚ÄúYes. You‚Äôll understand once you put them on.‚Äù
Tyler was the first to take the bait. He grinned and slipped the golden jersey over his T-shirt. The fabric was heavier than he expected, and as soon as it touched his skin, he felt a strange warmth spread through his body.
‚ÄúWhoa... this feels... kinda awesome,‚Äù Tyler mumbled, running his hands over the metallic sheen of the jersey. He didn‚Äôt notice the slight change in his posture‚Äîthe way he stood a little straighter, his expression becoming blanker, his thoughts slower.
‚ÄúSee?‚Äù Richard‚Äôs voice was soothing, almost hypnotic. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre already part of the team.‚Äù
Tyler blinked slowly, trying to process what was happening. His mind felt foggy, but he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to care. ‚ÄúYeah, bro... I feel, like, really good.‚Äù
Evan laughed, thinking his friend was just messing around. ‚ÄúDude, what are you talking about? You sound like an idiot.‚Äù
But Tyler just smiled, his eyes unfocused. ‚ÄúNah, bro. You gotta try it. It‚Äôs, like... sick.‚Äù
Evan, still amused by Tyler‚Äôs change in demeanor, shrugged. ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll give it a shot.‚Äù
He took the second golden jersey from Richard, slipping it on without a second thought. The moment it settled over his shoulders, the same warmth enveloped him. His thoughts slowed, his usual sharpness dulled.
‚ÄúDude... this feels weird,‚Äù Evan mumbled, blinking as his mind fogged over.
Richard watched with satisfaction as Evan‚Äôs expression softened, his lips curling into a dumb, vacant smile. The golden jersey had already taken hold.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool, right?‚Äù Tyler grinned, his voice deepening as he spoke. ‚ÄúBro, we gotta, like, get more of these.‚Äù
Evan nodded slowly, his usual sarcasm and wit completely erased. ‚ÄúYeah, bro. This is... legit.‚Äù
They both looked at each other, a blank understanding passing between them. Their voices became more jock-like, their speech slower and more simple. They were no longer Dylan‚Äôs witty, sharp-minded friends. Now, they were just Tyler and Evan, part of the growing golden team.
From the other side of the room, Dylan caught sight of his two friends wearing the golden jerseys, laughing dumbly and high-fiving each other. His stomach twisted. Something was terribly wrong. Tyler and Evan weren‚Äôt acting like themselves. They were... different.
He rushed over, trying to shake them out of their stupor. ‚ÄúTyler! Evan! What the hell are you doing?‚Äù
But they barely reacted. Tyler turned to Dylan with a blank, clueless grin. ‚ÄúChill, bro. We‚Äôre just... hanging with the team now.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, dude,‚Äù Evan added, his voice flat and vacant. ‚ÄúYou should, like, join us.‚Äù
Dylan‚Äôs heart pounded in his chest. His two best friends had been transformed, just like his teammates. Their minds weren‚Äôt their own anymore. They were part of Richard‚Äôs growing army of obedient, thoughtless drones.
‚ÄúRichard, stop this!‚Äù Dylan shouted, but Richard just smiled, the satisfaction of control gleaming in his eyes.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late, Dylan. They‚Äôve already joined the team. And soon, you will too.‚Äù
Dylan watched in horror as his friends, once full of personality and life, now stared at him with nothing but dumb smiles and empty eyes. They had become part of the golden team.
Richard‚Äôs plans didn‚Äôt stop with just transforming his team and sponsors. He had a bigger goal: to infiltrate and take over the entire eSports scene.
During a scrimmage against a rival team, Chad and Brad‚Äîonce Mason and Alex‚Äîacted as Richard‚Äôs covert agents. After the match, Chad approached a few of the rival players, complimenting them on their performance and offering them golden jerseys as a token of respect.
‚ÄúTry it on,‚Äù Chad urged with a sly grin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good-luck charm.‚Äù
The rival players, unaware of the true power behind the jerseys, slipped them on. As soon as the metallic gold fabric touched their skin, their expressions changed. Their eyes widened slightly, and their bodies seemed to relax. They thought they were just having fun, but the golden jerseys had already begun working their magic.
As the opposing players continued to wear the jerseys, they found themselves unable to take them off. The white shirts and ties beneath the jerseys felt comfortable, even right. Their thoughts became clouded, and before long, they were returning to Richard, eager to join the Nova Knights in their next match.
The captain of the Orange Outlaws was changed forover. Just like everyone should. No more Klaus, now he is Clay Gold.
Back in the VR training rooms, the Nova Knights had become a different team entirely. The golden helmets had proven to be much more than simple training tools‚Äîthey were full-blown mind-control devices. Once a player slipped on the helmet, their mind was no longer their own.
Chad and Brad had embraced the transformation fully. Every time they entered the VR pods, they lost more of themselves. The simulations they played weren‚Äôt just games‚Äîthey were mental conditioning. The helmets fed them commands, reshaping their identities to fit Richard‚Äôs vision. Their individuality was stripped away, replaced by the cold, calculating mindset of a perfect player.
But Dylan resisted. Every time he sat in the pod, every time the golden helmet was placed on his head, he fought back. He could feel the influence of the jersey and helmet pulling at his mind, but he wasn‚Äôt ready to give up. He was still himself‚Äîbarely.
One night, after a particularly grueling VR session, Dylan ripped the helmet off, gasping for air. His vision blurred with flashes of golden spirals, and for a moment, he wasn‚Äôt sure if he was still in the simulation.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt keep doing this,‚Äù Dylan muttered, his voice trembling. He looked over at his teammates‚Äîhis friends‚Äîbut they were gone. Chad, Brad, and the others sat motionless in their pods, their helmets still on, their minds completely lost to Richard‚Äôs control.
Dylan knew he had to find a way out. He couldn‚Äôt let Richard‚Äôs plan continue. Late one night, he sneaked into Richard‚Äôs office, searching for answers. What he found shocked him.
On Richard‚Äôs desk were blueprints and files‚Äîplans for the golden jerseys, the helmets, and the VR pods. But these weren‚Äôt just for the Nova Knights. They were part of a larger corporate experiment, a sinister plot to use eSports as a way to create obedient, mind-controlled soldiers.
Richard wasn‚Äôt just a coach. He was a corporate agent, using the Nova Knights as guinea pigs to test his mind-control devices. And soon, he planned to extend his influence to the entire eSports world.
Before Dylan could react, the office door swung open. Captain Richard stood in the doorway, holding a golden helmet in his hands.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done well to resist, Dylan,‚Äù Richard said calmly, stepping forward. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs time you fully join the team.‚Äù
Dylan backed away, his heart racing. He couldn‚Äôt let Richard win, but he was out of options. The pull of the golden jersey was too strong, and with every passing second, his thoughts became more clouded.
Richard placed the helmet on Dylan‚Äôs head, locking it in place. The room spun, and Dylan‚Äôs vision filled with the same golden spirals he had seen in his nightmares. His mind screamed for him to resist, but the voice was faint, drowned out by the overwhelming urge to submit.
In the hallway outside, Chad, Brad, and the rest of the team stood silently, waiting for Dylan to emerge. Their eyes glowed with the same golden spirals, their faces blank, obedient. They were no longer individuals. They were part of something larger.
As the golden spirals filled Dylan‚Äôs mind, he realized there was no escape. He could feel himself slipping away, becoming part of the team. His identity, his memories‚Äîeverything was being erased, replaced by Richard‚Äôs commands.
When Dylan finally stepped out of the office, his eyes were blank, glowing with the same golden spirals as the others. He was no longer Dylan.
He was part of the Nova Knights.

### The Golden Gym
It started as a normal day at Ironworks Gym. The familiar sounds of clanking weights, the rhythmic beat of the treadmill, and the low murmur of people chatting between sets filled the air. Everyone was comfortable in their routine, not yet knowing the change that was about to sweep through the place.
Captain Richard walked in for the first time that afternoon, a tall figure in his shiny metallic golden AC Milan kit. His presence immediately turned heads. Some assumed he was just another athlete, albeit a cocky one, showing off in an overly bright jersey. But there was something different about him, something in the way he carried himself‚Äîconfident, focused, and, above all, in control.
The gym had recently been bought out, and everyone knew there would be a new manager, but no one expected this.
Alex had been coming to Ironworks Gym for years. The gym was a constant in his life, a place where he could zone out, lift weights, and feel in control of his body. But lately, the atmosphere in the gym had changed, and not in a subtle way. It was a transformation he couldn‚Äôt quite explain, but it was there‚Äîsomething unsettling, yet strangely enticing.
It all started with Jackson. A few weeks ago, Jackson had been called into the office by Captain Richard, the gym‚Äôs new manager. Jackson had always been the alpha type‚Äîconfident, sure of himself, always pushing others to keep up with him. But after his one-on-one with Captain Richard, Jackson came out wearing a shining, metallic gold AC Milan kit. The number 15 glistened on the back, and there was something different about him.
His usual cocky grin was still there, but it carried a new weight, a certainty that made the hair on the back of Alex‚Äôs neck stand on end. "Co-captain now," Jackson had said, almost like he was issuing a challenge. "You‚Äôll see what‚Äôs coming, bro."
At first, Alex thought it was a joke, or maybe some weird marketing stunt. But then it happened again‚Äîthis time to Scott. Scott had always been quiet, focused, the kind of guy who kept to himself at the gym. When Scott came out of Captain Richard‚Äôs office, wearing the same gold kit, but this time with Number 9 emblazoned on the back, he was different. His silence had become intense, his focus now laser-sharp. He wasn‚Äôt just lifting anymore‚Äîhe was training with a purpose that Alex couldn‚Äôt quite understand.
Next was Lukas, who came out of that office grinning, his golden kit proudly displaying the number 7. Lukas had always been a strong guy, but now his agility seemed almost superhuman. His eyes held a gleam that made Alex uneasy.
And then there was Jacob. Jacob had always been unpredictable, the kind of guy who liked pushing boundaries. After his one-on-one with Richard, he stepped out in his golden AC Milan kit, Number 33 across his back. His workouts became almost brutal‚Äîintense in ways Alex hadn‚Äôt seen before.
More and more guys started walking out of Captain Richard‚Äôs office wearing the golden kits, each assigned a number, each transformed in ways Alex couldn‚Äôt quite put his finger on. It was as if the gym had become something else entirely‚Äîa breeding ground for a team Richard was assembling, one member at a time.
It didn‚Äôt take long before Alex noticed Richard watching him during his workouts, his eyes lingering a little too long, his gaze filled with an unspoken promise. Alex had managed to avoid that office for weeks, but deep down, he knew it was only a matter of time before he was called in.
Then, one evening, it happened.
‚ÄúAlex, let‚Äôs talk,‚Äù Richard said, his voice calm but commanding.
Alex hesitated. He‚Äôd seen what happened to the others. They walked into that office as themselves and walked out... different. Stronger, more focused, but with something missing, something that made them less human, more... machine-like.
But what choice did he have? Alex nodded and followed Richard into the office.
Alex‚Äôs heart raced as he sat across from Captain Richard in the gym's small, stark office. The air felt heavy, pressing down on him as the golden AC Milan kit draped over the back of the chair shimmered under the fluorescent lights. It looked more like an artifact than just a jersey, its metallic sheen mesmerizing.
Richard leaned back in his chair, his eyes scanning Alex like a predator assessing its prey. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been avoiding this for weeks, Alex,‚Äù he said smoothly, his voice almost too calm. ‚ÄúBut it was inevitable. You were always meant to be here.‚Äù
Alex shifted uncomfortably. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what‚Äôs happening to everyone,‚Äù he said, trying to keep his voice steady. ‚ÄúThey come out... different. I don‚Äôt know if I want that.‚Äù
Richard‚Äôs smile widened, his fingers steepling together. ‚ÄúDifferent? No. They come out better. You‚Äôve seen Jackson, Scott, Lukas, and Jacob. They‚Äôve become stronger, faster, more focused. They‚Äôre part of something greater now‚Äîpart of a team that‚Äôs unstoppable.‚Äù
Alex looked at the golden kit again, feeling an inexplicable pull toward it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like them.‚Äù
Richard stood, walking slowly to where the golden kit hung on the back of the chair. He lifted it, holding it out toward Alex like an offering. ‚ÄúYou are exactly like them. You just haven‚Äôt realized it yet.‚Äù
The jersey shimmered in Richard‚Äôs hands, the AC Milan crest catching the light. Alex felt a strange buzzing in his head, a faint hum that seemed to be coming from the kit itself. His thoughts began to blur, and for a moment, he couldn‚Äôt look away from the golden fabric.
Richard‚Äôs voice softened, low and soothing. ‚ÄúThis kit will change everything, Alex. Once you put it on, you‚Äôll understand. All the doubts, the hesitation‚Äîit‚Äôll fade. You‚Äôll become part of something bigger than yourself.‚Äù
Alex‚Äôs hand twitched involuntarily toward the kit, but he pulled back, shaking his head. ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm not doing this.‚Äù
Richard stepped closer, his eyes narrowing, his tone still calm but now more intense. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre resisting because you‚Äôre afraid. But think about it, Alex. You‚Äôve been stuck in the same routine, pushing yourself but getting nowhere. You‚Äôve felt it, haven‚Äôt you? That nagging feeling that you could be more, that there‚Äôs something missing.‚Äù
Alex swallowed hard, the words hitting him harder than he‚Äôd expected. He had felt that. It was why he‚Äôd come to the gym in the first place, why he pushed himself so hard every day. He didn‚Äôt say anything, but Richard saw the hesitation in his eyes.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what this kit is, Alex. It‚Äôs the missing piece. You‚Äôll be faster, stronger, more focused than you‚Äôve ever been. Your role is waiting for you‚ÄîNumber 10, the Midfielder. The one who keeps everything connected, who controls the game.‚Äù
The buzzing in Alex‚Äôs head grew louder, the golden kit almost pulsing in Richard‚Äôs hands now. He could feel his resolve weakening, his thoughts muddling together. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt... I don‚Äôt want to lose who I am.‚Äù
Richard smiled, taking a step forward, his voice soft but firm. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt lose yourself, Alex. You‚Äôll just become the best version of yourself. This kit, this team‚Äîit‚Äôs your destiny.‚Äù
Alex‚Äôs vision blurred for a moment, the room seeming to shrink around him. His mind felt heavy, clouded by the strange pull of the golden kit. Everything else‚Äîthe gym, the noise, the outside world‚Äîseemed distant, unimportant. All that mattered was the jersey in front of him and the promise it held.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tired of fighting it, Alex,‚Äù Richard said, his voice almost a whisper now. ‚ÄúStop resisting. Accept it.‚Äù
Without realizing it, Alex‚Äôs hand reached out, fingers brushing the smooth, cool fabric of the golden kit. The moment he touched it, a rush of warmth spread through his body, and his thoughts seemed to slow down, his resistance fading away. The doubts, the fear‚Äîthey dissolved, leaving only a sense of peace and clarity.
Richard‚Äôs smile grew wider as he saw the change in Alex‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúPut it on.‚Äù
Almost in a trance, Alex pulled the golden kit over his head. The moment the fabric touched his skin, it was as if a wave of energy surged through him, filling every muscle, every fiber of his being. His mind felt clearer, sharper. The nagging doubts that had plagued him for weeks were gone, replaced by a singular focus.
He looked down at the kit now clinging to his body, the metallic gold reflecting the light, the Number 10 emblazoned on the back. It felt right. It felt like it had always been a part of him, waiting for this moment.
Richard stepped back, studying Alex with satisfaction. ‚ÄúWelcome to the team, Number 10.‚Äù
Alex nodded, his mind completely calm now, his purpose clear. He wasn‚Äôt afraid anymore. He understood. The gym wasn‚Äôt just a place to work out‚Äîit was a place to transform, to become part of something greater. He had been chosen, and now he was part of the Golden Team.
As he left the office, the gym around him seemed different‚Äîclearer, more purposeful. The others‚ÄîJackson 15, Scott 9, Lukas 7, Jacob 33‚Äînodded at him as he walked past, their eyes gleaming with the same sense of power and purpose that now filled him.
He was one of them now.

### The Golden Office: Prequel
It started innocently enough. Brody, the department manager, had always been focused on pushing the team to meet targets. He was the classic middle-manager‚Äîdriven, slightly stressed, and always running between meetings. But that all changed the day he was invited to lunch by Ryan, a regional director who had recently joined the company.
Brody had noticed something odd about Ryan lately. The man had come into the company wearing a typical business suit, but over the past month, Brody saw him transitioning into something different‚Äîhis appearance, his attitude, even his clothes. Ryan had started wearing this strange golden jersey‚Äîa tight, shimmering AC Milan kit that made him look more like an athlete than a director. And ever since, his demeanor had changed too. He was more laid-back, confident, but with an edge, like he knew something others didn‚Äôt.
Brody‚Äôs curiosity got the better of him, and he agreed to meet Ryan for lunch. The moment he walked into the caf√©, Ryan greeted him with a firm handshake and an even firmer grin.
‚ÄúGood to see you, Brody,‚Äù Ryan said, his golden jersey glinting under the lights. ‚ÄúTake a seat, bro. I‚Äôve got something special for you.‚Äù
Brody sat down, eyeing Ryan‚Äôs muscular frame. He had never seen Ryan look this fit before. Ryan noticed his gaze and smirked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been wondering about the kit, haven‚Äôt you? I can tell.‚Äù
Brody cleared his throat, trying to play it off. ‚ÄúYeah, I mean, it‚Äôs... different. Didn‚Äôt know AC Milan had a fan club in the office.‚Äù
Ryan laughed, a deep, relaxed sound. ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs much more than that, bro. Trust me. It‚Äôs all part of something bigger.‚Äù He leaned in, his voice lowering. ‚ÄúAnd I think you‚Äôre ready for it.‚Äù
Brody shifted in his seat. ‚ÄúReady for what?‚Äù
Ryan didn‚Äôt answer immediately. Instead, he waved the waiter over and ordered for both of them. ‚ÄúTwo golden coffees, please.‚Äù
Brody raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúGolden coffee?‚Äù
Ryan grinned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see, bro. It‚Äôs the first step.‚Äù
The coffee arrived shortly after, and Brody stared at the cup in front of him. The liquid inside was unlike anything he‚Äôd seen‚Äîit shimmered, almost glowing, with a deep golden hue. The scent was rich and intoxicating, making his mouth water despite his hesitation.
Ryan lifted his cup, taking a long sip, his eyes locking with Brody‚Äôs. ‚ÄúGo ahead. Take a sip, bro. It‚Äôll change everything.‚Äù
Brody hesitated for a moment, but curiosity and peer pressure won out. He lifted the cup and took a cautious sip. The taste exploded on his tongue‚Äîsmooth, sweet, with a strange kick of energy that hit him like a shot of adrenaline. His entire body tingled as warmth spread through his veins, his muscles tightening as if he had just finished a workout.
Ryan smiled knowingly. ‚ÄúFeels good, right?‚Äù
Brody blinked, his mind spinning. ‚ÄúWhat... what is this?‚Äù
Ryan leaned back in his chair, flexing his arms. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the start of something amazing, bro. Once you‚Äôve had the golden coffee, you‚Äôll start feeling the pull. And soon, you‚Äôll be ready to put on the kit.‚Äù
Brody‚Äôs head buzzed with energy. He wanted to ask more questions, but the coffee had clouded his thoughts. All he could focus on was how good he felt‚Äîstronger, sharper, more alive.
The next day, Brody couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the golden coffee. He had been skeptical at first, but the way it made him feel‚Äîhe hadn‚Äôt experienced anything like it before. It was as if the coffee had unlocked something inside him, giving him a surge of power he couldn‚Äôt ignore.
That afternoon, Ryan showed up at Brody‚Äôs office, unannounced. He was wearing the same golden AC Milan kit, looking more confident than ever.
‚ÄúBrody, bro, you ready to take the next step?‚Äù Ryan asked, tossing a folded golden jersey onto Brody‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had the coffee. Now it‚Äôs time to join the team.‚Äù
Brody stared at the jersey, feeling the same pull he had felt when drinking the coffee. His fingers twitched toward it, but a part of him still resisted. ‚ÄúRyan, I don‚Äôt know... this feels... weird.‚Äù
Ryan shrugged, a casual smile on his face. ‚ÄúI get it, bro. It‚Äôs a big change. But trust me, once you slip this on, you won‚Äôt look back. You‚Äôll be better in every way.‚Äù
Brody looked at the jersey again. The way it shimmered in the light, the golden crest glinting, almost felt like it was calling to him. With a deep breath, he grabbed it and slowly pulled it over his head.
The moment the fabric touched his skin, Brody gasped. His muscles seemed to swell, his chest tightening as the jersey molded to his body. His posture straightened, his shoulders broadening, and a rush of energy shot through him‚Äîstronger than what the coffee had given him. His mind cleared, and suddenly everything felt right.
Ryan clapped him on the back. ‚ÄúThere you go, bro! Looking good!‚Äù
Brody flexed his arms, watching his biceps bulge under the tight golden jersey. He felt powerful, more in control than ever. ‚ÄúBro... this is unreal.‚Äù
Ryan grinned. ‚ÄúTold you. Welcome to the team, bro. You‚Äôre one of us now.‚Äù
The following week, Brody‚Äôs transformation didn‚Äôt go unnoticed. He started coming into the office every day wearing his golden AC Milan kit, his once-stressed demeanor replaced with pure confidence. He no longer talked about deadlines or quotas‚Äîinstead, he flexed, laughed, and kept throwing around the word ‚Äúbro‚Äù in nearly every sentence.
His employees exchanged confused glances as they saw their once-hard-driving manager become a jockish, overconfident version of himself.
One day, during a team meeting, Brody casually tossed his legs onto the conference table and grinned at his team. ‚ÄúAlright, bros, let‚Äôs crush this week! We‚Äôre all leveling up soon. Who‚Äôs ready to join me?‚Äù
His employees looked around awkwardly. Steve, the quietest member of the team, raised his hand timidly. ‚ÄúUh, join you for what, Brody?‚Äù
Brody‚Äôs grin widened as he reached under the table and pulled out another golden jersey. ‚ÄúTo join the team, bro! It‚Äôs all about leveling up. The golden kit makes you stronger, faster, better. You‚Äôve seen it in action.‚Äù
Steve frowned, eyeing the jersey like it was something alien. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, Brody. This seems‚Ä¶ weird. What‚Äôs with the whole ‚Äòbro‚Äô thing?‚Äù
Brody leaned forward, his muscular arms resting on the table. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how it is, bro. Once you‚Äôre part of the team, you get it. You‚Äôre stronger, more confident, and, well, you‚Äôre a bro! There‚Äôs no room for hesitation, just winning.‚Äù
The team stared at him in silence. Steve shook his head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs for me, Brody. I like the way things are.‚Äù
Brody‚Äôs smile tightened. ‚ÄúCome on, bro, don‚Äôt be like that. Just try it on. Once you do, you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm talking about.‚Äù
Steve looked around, uncomfortable with everyone watching him. But Brody‚Äôs insistence was unnerving. Reluctantly, he took the jersey from Brody‚Äôs hands, holding it as if it might bite him.
A few days passed, and Steve hadn‚Äôt put on the golden kit. Brody noticed. So did Ryan. And while Steve had managed to dodge wearing it so far, the pressure kept mounting.
One afternoon, as Steve was heading toward the breakroom, he found himself face-to-face with Mark and Alex, two guys who had already joined Brody‚Äôs team. They were standing by the coffee machine, both wearing their golden AC Milan kits, flexing casually while sipping on their golden coffees.
‚ÄúYo, Steve, bro,‚Äù Mark called out, grinning widely. ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you wearing your jersey yet? What, scared to level up?‚Äù
Steve‚Äôs heart raced. He had hoped to avoid this conversation. ‚ÄúUh, yeah, I‚Äôm just not sure it‚Äôs for me, guys.‚Äù
Alex laughed, tossing his empty coffee cup into the bin. ‚ÄúBro, you don‚Äôt get it yet. Once you put it on, everything changes. You‚Äôll be part of the team. Trust me, you‚Äôll feel amazing.‚Äù
Before Steve could respond, Brody appeared from around the corner, his golden jersey glinting under the fluorescent lights. ‚ÄúSteve, my man, what‚Äôs the holdup? It‚Äôs time to join us, bro.‚Äù
Steve shook his head, backing up slightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, Brody. I don‚Äôt need the jersey.‚Äù
Brody‚Äôs smile faded slightly, but his voice remained smooth. ‚ÄúSteve, bro, this isn‚Äôt optional. It‚Äôs time to level up.‚Äù
Mark and Alex stepped closer, each of them holding golden jerseys in their hands. Steve‚Äôs heart pounded in his chest as he backed up against the wall. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want to‚Äî‚Äù
But before he could finish, Brody and Mark moved quickly, pulling the golden jersey over his head. Steve struggled for a moment, but as soon as the fabric touched his skin, his resistance began to fade. His eyes widened as his body tensed, the jersey tightening around his chest and arms. His muscles swelled, his posture straightening as the transformation took hold.
Within moments, Steve‚Äôs face relaxed, his confusion replaced by a wide grin. He flexed his arms, admiring the way the golden jersey hugged his new, athletic frame. ‚ÄúBro... this is sick!‚Äù
Brody clapped him on the back. ‚ÄúTold you, bro! Welcome to the team, Chase 18.‚Äù
Steve‚Äîno, Chase‚Äîlaughed, his voice deeper now, more confident. ‚ÄúBro, I feel amazing! Why didn‚Äôt I do this sooner?‚Äù
Alex and Mark high-fived him, their grins matching his. ‚ÄúTold you, bro! The golden kit‚Äôs the best. We‚Äôre all bros now.‚Äù
Arthur and Luke sat quietly in the cramped breakroom, whispering to one another, eyes darting across the office. They were part of the last remaining resistance‚Äîa small group that had managed to avoid being recruited into the golden team. Nearly everyone else had succumbed, one by one, to the allure of the shimmering golden AC Milan kits. The jerseys, once a strange curiosity, now signified power and dominance in the office, worn proudly over white button-up shirts.
Arthur, sharp-eyed and determined, had resisted the longest. He saw what the kits did to people. First, they changed their bodies‚Äîmaking them stronger, more confident‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt stop there. Their minds followed, their personalities flattening, becoming more jockish and loyal to the team. Words like ‚Äúbro‚Äù flooded the office as workers flexed and laughed their way through their days, the golden coffee fueling their transformations.
Luke had been close to breaking. He almost wore the kit once, but Arthur had pulled him back from the edge, reminding him of who he really was. They had agreed‚Äîno matter what happened, they would resist together.
But now, things were getting worse. Brody and his golden team were coming for them, and they knew it.
It started subtly, just like with the others. Arthur found the golden spiral card in his desk drawer one morning, the swirling design almost pulling him in. He tossed it in the trash immediately, but the message was clear: they were targeting him next.
Luke noticed the tension in Arthur‚Äôs jaw as he sat at his desk, eyes scanning the office. He leaned over, voice low. ‚ÄúYou okay, man?‚Äù
Arthur nodded stiffly. ‚ÄúThey left the spiral for me. They‚Äôre coming soon. I can feel it.‚Äù
Luke clenched his fists. ‚ÄúThen we have to act fast. We can‚Äôt wait for them to surround you.‚Äù
They met after hours in a forgotten corner of the office‚Äîa spot where the golden team rarely went, too consumed with flexing and joking near the breakroom or conference room. It was the last place where they could talk freely without fear of being overheard.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôve already converted too many,‚Äù Arthur said, his voice quiet but steady. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of time.‚Äù
Luke nodded. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need a plan. If we don‚Äôt get out soon, they‚Äôll‚Äî‚Äù
He stopped mid-sentence. Footsteps echoed down the hallway, growing louder. The door to the small breakroom creaked open, and in walked Brody, flanked by two others from the golden team, all wearing their kits proudly over white shirts.
Brody grinned, his muscles flexing under the tight golden fabric. ‚ÄúHey, Arthur. Luke. What are you guys doing here all alone?‚Äù
Luke‚Äôs heart pounded in his chest. Arthur stepped forward, trying to block Brody‚Äôs path. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not interested, Brody. Just leave us alone.‚Äù
Brody‚Äôs grin widened, but there was no humor in his eyes. ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs not that simple anymore, bro. You see, we‚Äôve got a jersey with your name on it.‚Äù
From behind his back, Brody pulled out a folded golden AC Milan kit. It shimmered under the fluorescent lights, almost glowing as he tossed it onto the table between them.
‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù Brody said smoothly. ‚ÄúJust try it on. You‚Äôll feel amazing. Trust me, bro.‚Äù
Arthur stepped back instinctively, his eyes locked on the golden jersey. He knew what would happen if he touched it‚Äîhe‚Äôd seen it too many times before. His resistance would crumble, his body would change, and soon, he‚Äôd be flexing and talking like the rest of them, lost to the golden team.
Luke could see the panic in Arthur‚Äôs eyes. Without thinking, he lunged forward, pushing the jersey away from Arthur. ‚ÄúStay away from him!‚Äù Luke shouted.
But in his haste to protect Arthur, Luke‚Äôs hand brushed against the golden fabric.
The moment his fingers grazed the kit, Luke froze. His breath hitched as a jolt of electricity shot up his arm. His muscles tensed, and a strange warmth spread through his body, as if the jersey were reaching out, pulling him in. Luke tried to pull his hand away, but it was too late‚Äîthe jersey had already started its work.
Arthur‚Äôs eyes widened in horror. ‚ÄúLuke, no!‚Äù
Luke‚Äôs heart raced as he felt the pull of the golden kit. He had been so close to saving Arthur, but now, he was caught in the same trap. His hand trembled as he tried to fight the sensation, but the golden fabric was warm, inviting, and he could feel his resolve slipping away.
Brody‚Äôs grin only widened as he watched Luke struggle. ‚ÄúI told you, bro. It‚Äôs inevitable. Once you touch the kit, there‚Äôs no going back. Only we can touch the kit as much as we like, see this‚Äù
Luke‚Äôs body shuddered as the golden energy coursed through him. His muscles twitched, his mind buzzed, and he could feel the power of the jersey calling to him. It would be so easy to give in, to let the transformation take him, to join the team like so many others. But deep down, he didn‚Äôt want it. He didn‚Äôt want to lose himself.
‚ÄúArthur...‚Äù Luke gasped, his voice strained as he tried to pull his hand away from the jersey. ‚ÄúI... I didn‚Äôt mean to...‚Äù
Arthur rushed forward, grabbing Luke‚Äôs wrist and pulling him back. ‚ÄúFight it, Luke. You can still fight it.‚Äù
But Luke‚Äôs eyes were starting to glaze over, his body slowly responding to the touch of the golden kit. His muscles began to tense and swell, his posture straightening as the pull grew stronger.
Arthur shook him, desperate. ‚ÄúLuke! Stay with me!‚Äù
Luke groaned, his free hand gripping the edge of the table as he tried to hold on. The golden jersey sat between them, glowing with an almost sinister warmth, and Luke could feel it drawing him in, deeper and deeper.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt... I don‚Äôt want to be like them...‚Äù Luke muttered, his voice faltering. His grip on Arthur‚Äôs hand tightened, but the temptation was growing too strong.
Brody leaned against the wall, watching the struggle with amusement. ‚ÄúCome on, Luke. You‚Äôve already touched it. You know what happens next. Just let go, bro. You‚Äôll be one of us soon enough.‚Äù
Luke‚Äôs body trembled as the last of his resistance began to slip. His muscles were already changing, thickening under his skin, preparing for the transformation that was about to overtake him.
Arthur‚Äôs heart pounded in his chest as he held onto Luke. He couldn‚Äôt lose him‚Äînot like this.
With a sudden burst of strength, Arthur yanked Luke back, away from the golden jersey. Luke stumbled, falling into Arthur‚Äôs arms, breathing heavily. His body still buzzed with the energy from the kit, but for now, he had pulled him away from its grip.
Brody shook his head, almost disappointed. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hold out forever, Arthur. Luke‚Äôs already halfway there. It‚Äôs just a matter of time.‚Äù
But Arthur wasn‚Äôt ready to give up. He helped Luke to his feet, his eyes filled with determination. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not done yet.‚Äù
Luke, though weak and shaken, nodded, still fighting the effects of the jersey. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not... I‚Äôm not gone yet, bro,‚Äù he said, his voice strained, but with a flicker of hope.
Brody and the others laughed, pushing off from the wall. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see, bro. We‚Äôll see.‚Äù
The battle wasn‚Äôt over, but Arthur knew they were running out of time. The golden team was closing in, and Luke‚Äôs accidental touch had already put them at a disadvantage. But as long as they had each other, they still had a chance‚Äîhowever slim‚Äîto resist the growing force of the golden team.
And as long as they could hold out, they would fight.
Arthur‚Äôs heart pounded in his chest as he and Luke bolted down the hallway, dodging cubicles and avoiding the watchful eyes of the golden team. Luke, still weak from the near-transformation, stumbled behind him, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The golden AC Milan jersey he had accidentally touched was clutched tightly in his hand, and as they ran, he hastily shoved it into his bag, hiding it from view.
Behind them, Brody and the other golden team members watched them go, trying to chase them. Brody‚Äôs lips curled into a knowing smile, as if he already knew how this would end. ‚ÄúRun while you can, bros,‚Äù Brody muttered under his breath, flexing his arms. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be back.‚Äù
Arthur threw open the door to the office locker room, pulling Luke inside before slamming it shut. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a dim glow over the rows of lockers and benches. They were alone for now, but Arthur knew it wouldn‚Äôt be long before the golden team came looking.
Luke slumped against the wall, wiping the sweat from his brow. ‚ÄúI almost... I almost lost it, man,‚Äù he muttered, still shaking. His eyes flicked to the bag at his side, where the golden jersey now rested, hidden but pulsing with its strange energy.
Arthur crouched beside him, his voice low. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have much time. They‚Äôll come for us soon, and we need to be ready.‚Äù
Luke nodded weakly. ‚ÄúYeah, bro. But what now? We can‚Äôt fight them...‚Äù
Arthur shook his head. ‚ÄúNo. But we can hide. We can blend in, pretend like nothing‚Äôs changed until we find a way out.‚Äù
The locker room was quiet, save for the distant hum of the office beyond the door. Arthur paced, his mind racing as he tried to come up with a way for them to escape without being spotted. Luke sat on the bench, still recovering from the strange sensations that had gripped him when he touched the jersey.
‚ÄúWhat if we blend in?‚Äù Arthur said suddenly, breaking the silence.
Luke frowned. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù
Arthur gestured to the lockers. ‚ÄúThe golden team knows who we are. If we stay as we are, they‚Äôll find us easily. But if we look like we‚Äôre part of the office‚Äîlike we‚Äôre just another cog in the machine‚Äîthey might not notice us. We could pretend to be someone else.‚Äù
Luke raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúLike... camouflage?‚Äù
Arthur nodded, scanning the rows of lockers. ‚ÄúExactly. If we dress like some of the others‚Äîsomeone they‚Äôre not targeting‚Äîthey won‚Äôt pay attention to us.‚Äù
Luke thought for a moment, then stood up, still shaky but determined. ‚ÄúYeah, bro... that could work. What do we need?‚Äù
Arthur crossed the room and opened a locker. Inside, he found what he was looking for: a neatly folded green suits. The classic attire for the accounting department‚Äîprofessional, bland, and most importantly, invisible.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll disguise ourselves as accountants,‚Äù Arthur said, pulling the suit from the locker. ‚ÄúNo one bothers the accounting department. They keep their heads down, they don‚Äôt draw attention. We can use that to our advantage.‚Äù
Luke grabbed another suit from a nearby locker, slipping off his jacket and quickly changing into the new attire. As he buttoned up the shirt and adjusted the tie, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. It was strange‚Äîjust moments ago, he had been on the brink of transformation, nearly consumed by the golden team‚Äôs power. But now, in this suit, he looked... normal again. Almost like he was one of them.
Arthur finished changing and nodded to Luke. ‚ÄúAlright. We look the part. Now we just need to act the part.‚Äù
With their green business suits on, they exited the locker room cautiously. The office was still alive with activity, golden team members walking around in their shimmering kits, laughing, flexing, and tossing "bro" into every sentence. But there were still a few normal employees milling about, unaware of the resistance lurking in their midst.
Arthur and Luke kept their heads down, walking with purpose as if they were late for a meeting. They passed a group of golden team members‚ÄîChase 18 and Blake 11 among them‚Äîwho were busy discussing their next workout, oblivious to the disguised pair slipping by.
‚ÄúJust stay calm,‚Äù Arthur whispered. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at them.‚Äù
Luke nodded, his heart pounding in his chest. The temptation to glance back, to see if anyone was watching, gnawed at him, but he kept his focus straight ahead.
They made their way through the maze of cubicles, heading toward the exit at the far end of the office. With each step, Arthur could feel the weight of their situation. They were running out of time. They couldn‚Äôt keep hiding forever‚Äîeventually, the golden team would find them, and then it would be too late.
But for now, they had a chance. If they could get out of the building, they might be able to regroup with the rest of the resistance.
As they approached the exit, they passed Brody, who stood near the door with a few other members of the golden team. He was smiling as he chatted casually with his bros. His eyes flicked toward Arthur and Luke as they walked by, but he didn‚Äôt say anything. Just smiled knowingly, as if he could sense something was off but didn‚Äôt care to stop them.
Arthur‚Äôs breath hitched, but he kept walking, his steps steady, his face expressionless. He could feel Luke tense beside him, but they didn‚Äôt break stride.
Once they were past, Arthur whispered, ‚ÄúAlmost there.‚Äù
Arthur and Luke moved through the office halls with purpose, dressed in their carefully chosen camouflage‚Äîtheir accounting business suits. The tension was thick in the air, but they had managed to avoid the eyes of the golden team as they worked their way toward the exit.
But what Arthur didn‚Äôt know‚Äîwhat Luke hadn‚Äôt told him‚Äîwas that the moment he touched that shimmering golden kit, something had changed. Something inside Luke had weakened, a crack had formed in his resistance. As they ran for cover in the locker room, Luke had slipped on the jersey, letting its pull take over. Beneath the dull gray suit, the golden fabric now clung to his skin, tightening with every step, every breath.
Luke wasn‚Äôt Luke anymore.
He was Jimmy‚Äîa new recruit for the golden team, silently waiting for the right moment.
The two of them walked with brisk, steady steps, blending into the office crowd. The weight of their situation pressed on them both, but for Arthur, there was still hope. He hadn‚Äôt realized that hope was slipping away with every minute that passed.
Luke‚Äîno, Jimmy‚Äîkept his head low, following Arthur‚Äôs lead, but his mind was no longer on escaping. His heart pounded with excitement beneath the golden jersey, hidden under his buttoned-up business suit. His transformation had already begun, the energy from the golden kit filling him with strength, confidence, and a new identity. He wasn‚Äôt resisting anymore. He was part of the team. He wanted to be part of the team.
But for now, he needed to wait. Arthur still thought he was Luke‚Äîstill thought they were on the same side.
As they approached the far end of the office, Arthur‚Äôs nerves were on high alert. The building was alive with activity, golden team members moving between departments, flexing, laughing, completely oblivious to the two ‚Äúaccountants‚Äù slipping through their ranks.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost out,‚Äù Arthur whispered, glancing over his shoulder. ‚ÄúJust stay close.‚Äù
Jimmy nodded, his face calm, but inside, he was waiting for the inevitable moment when Arthur would find out. His fingers twitched against the fabric of his suit, feeling the golden jersey underneath.
They reached the final hallway just before the exit when things took a turn. Out of nowhere, a group of golden team members appeared‚ÄîBrody at the front, grinning widely. Behind him, Chase 18 and Blake 11 stood, arms crossed, blocking their way.
‚ÄúWell, well, well,‚Äù Brody said, his voice dripping with amusement. ‚ÄúI wondered how long you two would try to run.‚Äù
Arthur froze, his heart dropping into his stomach. They had been found.
‚ÄúBrody,‚Äù Arthur said slowly, his eyes darting around the room, searching for an escape route. ‚ÄúLet us go. We‚Äôre not part of this.‚Äù
Brody chuckled, shaking his head. ‚ÄúCome on, bro. You‚Äôve been resisting long enough. But now? It‚Äôs time.‚Äù
Arthur stepped back, but something felt off. He glanced at Luke, expecting his friend to be just as tense, just as ready to bolt‚Äîbut Luke stood there, perfectly calm. Too calm.
‚ÄúLuke?‚Äù Arthur asked, his voice tinged with confusion.
Luke‚Äîno, Jimmy‚Äîsmiled slowly, and for the first time, Arthur saw it. The change. The subtle shift in posture, the way Luke‚Äôs body seemed just a little bulkier under the suit, the way he was standing too confidently.
Then, as if on cue, Jimmy unbuttoned his suit jacket, revealing the golden AC Milan jersey shimmering underneath. The golden crest gleamed against his chest, the fabric tight against his muscular frame. His transformation was complete.
Arthur‚Äôs stomach lurched. ‚ÄúLuke...?‚Äù
Jimmy laughed, flexing his arms under the golden kit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jimmy now, bro. Luke‚Äôs gone. I joined the team. I should‚Äôve done it sooner.‚Äù
Arthur took a step back, his mind reeling. ‚ÄúNo... You... You didn‚Äôt.‚Äù
Jimmy‚Äôs grin only widened. ‚ÄúI did, bro. They got to me, and you know what? It feels amazing.‚Äù He took a step closer, his eyes gleaming with the same confident energy that radiated from the rest of the golden team. ‚ÄúYou should join us, Arthur. You‚Äôre the only one left.‚Äù
Arthur‚Äôs heart raced as he realized the full extent of what had happened. His best friend‚Äîhis last ally‚Äîwas gone. He was surrounded, and the golden team had already won.
Arthur‚Äôs hands shook as he took another step back, his eyes darting between Jimmy and the rest of the team. They were closing in, and he knew there was no easy way out.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this, Jimmy,‚Äù Arthur said, trying to reach the part of Luke that might still be in there. ‚ÄúYou can fight it. You don‚Äôt have to be one of them.‚Äù
But Jimmy just laughed, shaking his head. ‚ÄúBro, it‚Äôs already done. I‚Äôm part of the team now, and it‚Äôs the best thing that ever happened to me. You‚Äôre missing out, Arthur. Once you put on the jersey, you‚Äôll understand.‚Äù
Brody stepped forward, tossing another golden AC Milan kit onto the ground in front of Arthur. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right, bro. Just slip it on. You‚Äôve been resisting for long enough. It‚Äôs time to join the team.‚Äù
Arthur stared at the jersey, the temptation creeping up on him like a wave. It would be so easy‚Äîjust one step, one touch, and he would be free of the fear, the running. He could be like them‚Äîstrong, confident, unstoppable.
But he couldn‚Äôt. He wouldn‚Äôt.
Arthur shook his head, his jaw tightening. ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm not joining.‚Äù
Brody‚Äôs smile faded slightly, and he shrugged. ‚ÄúYour call, bro. But trust me‚Äîyou‚Äôll come around.‚Äù
Jimmy flexed again, grinning at Arthur. ‚ÄúYeah, bro. You‚Äôll be one of us soon. It‚Äôs just a matter of time.‚Äù
Arthur felt trapped. His mind raced for a way out, but the walls were closing in. His best friend was gone, and now the team was coming for him.
The golden jersey lay at his feet, shimmering in the dim office light.
Arthur knew he couldn‚Äôt resist forever‚Äîbut for now, he would fight.
Arthur stood frozen, staring down at the golden AC Milan jersey shimmering at his feet. The pressure was unbearable, his mind swirling with panic, fear, and confusion. His best friend, Luke‚Äîno, Jimmy‚Äîwas grinning at him, already fully transformed into a member of the golden team. Brody and the others stood around him, flexing and waiting for him to make his decision.
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt resist forever, bro,‚Äù Brody said, his voice calm, but commanding. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to join us. We need someone like you‚Äîa real asset.‚Äù
Arthur‚Äôs heart pounded in his chest. He had held out longer than anyone, but now, standing in front of the team, the golden jersey glinting beneath the fluorescent lights, he felt his resolve slipping. What was left to fight for? He had no more allies, no more strength to keep running. It would be so easy to give in, to finally stop resisting.
Jimmy stepped forward, placing a hand on Arthur‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúCome on, bro. Don‚Äôt make this harder than it needs to be. You‚Äôll feel incredible once you put it on.‚Äù
Arthur‚Äôs hands trembled as he knelt down, his fingers brushing against the golden fabric. The moment his skin touched the jersey, a familiar jolt of energy shot through him, just like it had when he touched Luke‚Äôs. This time, however, Arthur didn‚Äôt pull away. He lifted the jersey slowly, feeling the pull growing stronger, the warmth of the fabric seeping into his skin.
Brody smiled, his arms crossed as he watched Arthur‚Äôs surrender. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, bro. You‚Äôre going to be great.‚Äù
Arthur slipped the golden jersey over his head. It clung to his body like it was made for him, the fabric tightening around his chest and arms, molding itself perfectly to his form. His muscles swelled, his posture straightened, and the buzzing in his mind intensified. He could feel the transformation happening, his body growing stronger, his mind becoming sharper.
But something was different. As the jersey settled against his skin, Brody tossed something else at his feet‚Äîa golden goalie kit, complete with matching gloves. The jersey was slightly different from the others, with padded areas on the chest and shoulders, designed for the team‚Äôs new goalkeeper.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been needing a new goalie, bro,‚Äù Brody said, grinning. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre it.‚Äù
Arthur‚Äôs hands shook as he picked up the golden gloves, the fabric warm and inviting. As he slid his hands into them, the transformation took full control. His muscles tightened further, his legs felt sturdier, and his reflexes sharpened instantly, like he had been born to stand in front of the goal. The gloves fit perfectly, as if they had been waiting for him all along.
Arthur flexed his fingers, feeling the strength coursing through him. His mind, which had been full of resistance and fear just moments ago, now felt clear, focused on one goal: being the best. His hesitation melted away, replaced by an overwhelming sense of purpose. He was no longer Arthur, the last holdout of the resistance.
He was Arthur 1, the team‚Äôs new goalie.
Arthur stood tall, his golden goalie kit gleaming under the lights. His mind was calm, at peace with the decision he had made. There was no more running, no more fighting. He was part of the golden team now, and it felt right.
Brody clapped him on the back. ‚ÄúSee, bro? I told you it‚Äôd be great. You‚Äôre going to crush it out there.‚Äù
Jimmy grinned at him, flexing his arms. ‚ÄúWelcome to the team, Arthur. You look sick in that goalie kit, bro. We‚Äôre going to dominate with you guarding the net.‚Äù
Arthur nodded, adjusting the gloves on his hands. The transformation was complete. He could feel the power of the golden team flowing through him, the connection to his new teammates stronger than ever.
As they walked back toward the main office, Arthur‚Äôs thoughts drifted to the game ahead. The team had needed a new striker, but what they really needed was someone strong enough to protect their goal. Arthur had become that player‚Äîthe wall they needed to win. And as far as he was concerned, nothing could get past him now.
Arthur stood with the rest of the golden team, fully integrated and ready for whatever came next. His golden jersey and gloves glinted in the light as he flexed his arms, feeling the strength surging through his body. He was no longer the hesitant, fearful man who had resisted for so long. Now, he was part of something bigger‚Äîsomething stronger.
Brody smiled at the assembled team, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction. ‚ÄúAlright, bros. We‚Äôve got the perfect squad now. Let‚Äôs go crush it.‚Äù
As they walked together, Arthur‚Äînow Arthur 1‚Äîknew that he had found his place. No more resistance, no more fear. Just the golden team, united and unstoppable.
And with him as the goalie, there was no way they could lose.

### The Golden Wave
Next thing you know, the four men, united in their shiny golden German Adidas soccer kits, noticed another potential recruit in the park. A 27-year-old man sat on a bench, wearing headphones and completely absorbed in his music. He was oblivious to the strange events unfolding around him.
Liam, Ethan, the bystander, and the new person exchanged knowing glances. With synchronized movements, they approached the man from behind. Their eyes were filled with a determined and almost eerie sense of purpose.
The man on the bench, lost in his music, didn‚Äôt notice their approach until it was too late. They surrounded him, blocking any escape. Liam reached into the duffel bag and pulled out another shiny golden kit. This one bore the number 45 on the back.
With a quick nod from Ethan, they moved in unison. The 27-year-old man finally sensed their presence and looked up, startled. Before he could react, they pushed the kit into his hands and over his head. His initial resistance was brief; as soon as the fabric touched his skin, a transformation began.
His eyes widened in shock and then glazed over as the kit's influence took hold. He stood up, still dazed, and finished putting on the kit. The number 45 glistened on his back in the setting sun. The previous confusion on his face was replaced with an expression of pure joy and unity.
Liam and Ethan smiled, satisfied with their success. The 27-year-old, now number 45, joined their ranks seamlessly. The group, now five strong, exuded an air of unity and purpose. They looked around, their eyes scanning the park for more potential recruits, ready to continue their mission of transformation.

Isaac Gold:¬† They almost caught me¬†!!! I was shitting my pants. If it wasn‚Äôt that 039 cares about me, you‚Äôd be talking to C3P0 now. It was just for a joke but you messed up, it didn‚Äôt work like you said it would. There were mistakes.
Tech Bro: I know, I know, I‚Äôm sorry. I messed up. Here take this‚Ä¶it will be another fun Joke.
Isaac: No, No, No, I‚Äôm never doing that again. I‚Äôve learned my lesson.
Tech Bro: Take it anyway‚Ä¶.You never know when you might use it. And Remember April Fool‚Äôs Day happens every year. Also remember Bro..I told you; WE have your back. I have it covered. They can never permanently hurt you.
Isaac: Ok I‚Äôll keep it but I‚Äôll never use it. It‚Äôs still too Risky!

### The Plan
Isaac knew he wasn‚Äôt the brightest tool in the shed. He knew sports and lifting and flirting. Those were things he was best at. He also knew how to get things he wanted, and this time he needed information. More precisely tech info. All the Bros were planning April Fools jokes on each other and he didn‚Äôt want to be left out. Flashing his smile and plying the right people with just the right amount of drinks did the trick. The info was highly classified and technical but he thought he‚Äôd be able to pull it off.
Isaac had to be quick but he knew this would work. Breaking into the hive base could be risky. Isaac was told what conduit the drones program files were located in and what he needed to do to achieve his desired effect. Once inside though he got lost. Did he make a left or right at the second conduit?¬† He tried right and after proceeding a little bit he knew he made the right choice. He found the junction box he was looking for. Plugging in the flash drive that a tech Bro had made for him (after quite a few drinks and more then just his smile) he was done and made his quick escape unnoticed.
Once back at home he noticed PDU-039 was his usual stoic self.¬† How‚Äôs your day been going, Sir?‚Äù Issac asked ‚ÄúUneventful‚Äù 039 replied. ‚ÄúHow was your day, Isaac?‚Äù 039 inquired. ‚ÄúUneventful‚Äù Isaac joked. After some small talk Isaac went up to change for dinner. He was feeling like his mission was a failure. While upstairs Isaac thought he heard a radio playing but upon running down he saw his April fools‚Äô joke had worked. 039 program files had been changed to make him think he was Ariana Grande and he was now in costume singing ‚ÄúI feel Pretty‚Äù in the middle of the living room. Isaac laughed and laughed. He also took some videos. After a few hours, Isaac got tired and asked 039 about going to bed. 039 replied "I have a big show tour coming up and I need to practice‚Äù Isaac gave up and left 039 singing ‚ÄúThe boy is mine‚Äù as he went up to bed.
Upon awaking Isaac didn‚Äôt hear any singing from down stairs. Everything seemed quiet. The Tech Bro he got the flash drive from said the effects would only last for an hour or two before the program would detect the corrupt code and delete it. Isaac figured 039 would be recharged and back to normal.¬† Upon entering the living room though Isaac was shocked to see 039 dressed in an odd fashion, as Glinda from Wicked. ‚ÄúIsaac, my boy, I am done practicing for the tour but I realized I need to prepare for the ‚ÄúWicked 2‚Äù tour and my Oscar acceptance speech for next year."
Isaac quickly left the house thinking ‚Äúthe Tech Bro did say an hour or two, right? Or was it a day or two? I don‚Äôt think he said a week or two???????? And the tech Bro also said this would just effect 039 what if‚Ä¶no It couldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.could it?????

### The Intruder
Nowadays - April 2nd, 2025 ‚Äì Morning
The Hive awakens in an unusual state of turmoil. As always, polo drone 073 is the first to complete its recharge cycle. With a steady pace, it moves down the Hive's main corridor leading to the supply room. At the end of the corridor, it spots a figure on the ground‚Äîsome drone needs assistance. It‚Äôs PDU-039, in a semi-conscious, confused state.
He is wearing improper clothing for a drone‚Äîthis is not like him!
073 shakes him. He stirs.
"PDU-039, restore system functionality."
039: "System operational. Errors detected. Recharge cycle incomplete. Multiple interruptions detected‚Äîlast 12 hours of memory compromised."
Beside 039‚Äôs body lies a black leather bracelet. A clue. PDU-073 has no doubts‚Äîthe Hive's security has been breached.
"PDU-039, can you walk?"
"Affirmative."
"We need to patrol the area. First, let‚Äôs go to the control room‚Äîwe‚Äôll know more once we review the security footage."
CONTROL ROOM
039 and 073 stand before the monitor.
"Play the last 12 hours of recordings." 073 activates voice command
The drones carefully watch the first few minutes of footage when suddenly, a shadow descends from an abandoned service duct, moving stealthily towards the Data Room.
039: "Pause!"
The still frame leaves no room for doubt‚Äîa golden jersey, the number 45.
"Isaac Gold!!"
"That damn boy," 039 exclaims. "What the hell did he do?!"
073 remains motionless. His voice is firm.
"The boy has seen too much. We need to take action. 039, any suggestions?"
The situation is serious. 039 must do what needs to be done. He is a drone, and the Hive comes first. He cannot allow the Hive to be further compromised.
039 speaks the words he never wanted to say: "Treatment 039."
A flash of light reflects off 073‚Äôs dark visor.
"039, are you sure? That protocol hasn‚Äôt been used in years, it‚Äôs not safe! It repeats, are you sure you want to proceed?"
"Affirmative. The bro must be treated. The bro has seen too much. The procedure will be carried out tonight."
073: "039, does it need assistance?"
039: "Negative. The bro is 039‚Äôs responsibility. 039 will handle it personally."
GOLDEN BAR
Izzy (aka Isaac) is, as always, behind the bar, pouring beers and flashing flirtatious glances at the bros. As usual, they surround him, laughter filling the room, the atmosphere warm and lively.
Across the hall, near the entrance, someone is not celebrating. A massive, dark figure stands still, assessing the situation, waiting in the shadows for the right moment to act.
Izzy heads to the back to restock the beer. 039 follows silently behind him.
Izzy senses his presence and turns around with his usual smile, happy to see him.
"Hey Master, everything okay, Mast‚Ä¶?"
He doesn‚Äôt even finish the sentence.
039 grabs him with the arm, his grip is like steel. Without a word, 039 leads him toward the back door.
Izzy immediately senses something is off. 039 has never been much of a talker, but tonight, he's different. Not violent but determined, more resolute than ever.
Izzy struggles, trying to break free, but the drone doesn‚Äôt loosen his grip. He keeps walking.
"Master, what are you doing? Let me go!"
039 continues. Izzy's lips were moving, but it hears nothing, isolated in the void of the drone. He has only one objective: Izzy must undergo the treatment.
They walk through the Hive‚Äôs corridor. Izzy‚Äôs screams grew louder, his voice filled with anguish.
"Let me go! Let me go!"
039:
"Izzy has not shown discipline. Izzy will learn discipline. The discipline of the drone. The law of Hive. Izzy will be part of Hive. Izzy will become a Polo-Drone."
"WHAT?? HELP?? 039 has lost it!"
His voice breaks into sobs.
"No! No! I want to stay a Gold Bro!"
"You promised to protect me!"
Izzy is now overwhelmed, unable to resist anymore.
THE TREATMENT
The door to the treatment room opens.
At the center of the room, a chair. On the wall, a wide screen.
039 forcefully throws Izzy onto the chair. His head, hands, and legs are strapped down.
"Command 039 - Activate Treatment Protocol ."
The screen lights up. A black and gold spiral casts its glow across the dark room. It starts spinning.
Izzy can do nothing but watch.
He cannot look away.
RELAX RELAX RELAX RELAX RELAX
DISABLING FREE WILL
DISABLING FREE WILL
DISABLING FREE WILL
THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY
"Help, help!" Izzy sobs.
039 stands beside him, supervising the procedure impassive.
YOU ARE SAFE
FREE WILL AT 90%
YOU ARE SECURE
FREE WILL AT 80%
"039, please stop!" His voice grows softer, more submissive.
039 does not move. 039 proceeds.
YOU WILL NOT WORRY
FREE WILL AT 60%
"039..." Izzy‚Äôs head feels lighter and lighter.
YOU WILL KEEP WATCHING
FREE WILL AT 50%
The golden light reflects off Izzy‚Äôs glassy eyes.
YOU WILL LISTEN
FREE WILL AT 45%
The music invades Izzy‚Äôs mind, facing no resistance.
YOU WILL ACCEPT
FREE WILL AT 40%
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING
"Forget the last 24 hours," 039 whispers in his ear.
FREE WILL AT 20%
YOU WILL OBEY
FREE WILL AT 10%
YOU WILL DO AS YOU ARE TOLD
REPEAT:
FROM NOW ON
"From now on," Izzy repeats mindlessly.
IT IS
"It is," Izzy again.
A
"a" without resistance.
P
"p" monotone.
‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶
APRIL FOOLS!!!!!!!!!!!
The spiral stops.
The music cuts out.
The lights turn on.
Izzy shakes his head, as if waking from a deep sleep‚Äîdazed, but relaxed. He‚Äôs fine.
"Master, what happened? Why am I here?"
He doesn‚Äôt remember what happened. He‚Äôs a little confused but throws himself into 039‚Äôs strong arms, knowing he‚Äôll always find comfort there.
"Now go, little bro. Return to your Gold Bros and behave." 039 stands tall, stoic, unmoving.
073, waiting by the door, watches Izzy leave, then steps into the room.
"You scared the hell out of him! You almost went too far!"
039 nods.
"All under control. He‚Äôs more Gold than ever! Doesn‚Äôt remember a thing. The Hive is safe once again."

### Polo-Drone Unit 039 ‚Äì Next Level
It is a Polo-Drone Unit. It is PDU-039
It has been ever since it willingly chose to serve something greater: the Golden Army, the Hive.
Only the Hive could give it what it craved‚Äîwhat it needed.
A purpose. Discipline. A mission.
And day after day, 039 earned the trust the Hive placed in it by:
Training
Serving
Obeying
The purpose was strong. The mission was clear. But it couldn‚Äôt do it alone.
Because in the- Golden Army, in the Hive, no one is alone. No one gets left behind.
The victory of one is the victory of all.
The Golden Bros were there with him‚Äîthe Drone Bros helping him through the hard moments.
When one falls, the collective lifts them back up: more focused, more determined, stronger.
And now? Has PDU-039 given all it could?
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
A new challenge stands before it: Become a Level 2 Drone.
And where others see a challenge, 039 sees an opportunity. 039 doesn‚Äôt stop. 039 doesn‚Äôt think. 039 acts.
An opportunity to go further, to grow, to become perfect.
To become one with the Hive. One with the Level 2 Drone Bros:
Absolute Obedience
Absolute Commitment
Absolute Unity
This is its new mantra. That‚Äôs why the intensified training doesn‚Äôt scare it‚Äîit fuels it.
Because Level 2 isn‚Äôt free. It isn‚Äôt easy.
The uniform isn‚Äôt just for show‚Äîit‚Äôs a symbol, an ideal.
The uniform recognizes its wearer. And with them, it changes‚Äîin form and in spirit.
It shapes them, becoming one, in complete symbiosis.
Transformed. Upgraded. But not entirely changed.
At the dawn of conversion, one question was asked:
‚ÄúWill anything change?‚Äù
A brief silence.
Then the answer came:
‚ÄúPDU-039 is a Polo-Drone Unit. It exists to function. It exists to serve the Golden Army, the Golden Bros, and the Hive.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe mission doesn‚Äôt change‚Äîit‚Äôs pursued with more awareness, more responsibility, more commitment, more drive.‚Äù
THE CONVERSION
During conversion, the program downloaded into the Polo-Drone was crystal clear:
Train
Commit
Serve
Obey
Protect
Stand
Watch
Inspire
At the end of the conversion ceremony, they were all there to celebrate.
The Golden Bros. The Drones.
But they weren‚Äôt just celebrating one Drone‚Äôs milestone‚Äîthey knew that from that day on, the Golden Army had become stronger.
From that day on, there was a new pillar they could count on.
The mood was friendly, full of energy. PDU-039 felt it. And appreciated it.
But the program‚Äîinstalled and now fused within‚Äîremained stronger than ever in its mind.
Its mission is to protect and serve. Without doubt. Without hesitation.
Anyone who stands between the Drones and their objective is destined to fail‚Äîwhoever they are, wherever they come from.
Because Drones act with:
No distractions
No detours
No alternatives
When the time comes, PDU-039 will be ready.
PDU-039 is a Polo-Drone Unit. Level 2.

### Symphaty for the Drone
In a breathtaking cherry blossom garden in full bloom a drone is meticulously tending to his flowers.
The air is still. Sounds muffled, like a dream, a Paradise
"Good morning, excuse me, I must be lost," a boy addressing the drone
"Welcome, my friend. It has been expecting you," the drone replied with a warm smile. "Why that surprised look? You're not lost. You're exactly where you should be."
"And where is this? It's stunning. I've never seen anything like this," the boy said, taking in the serene beauty.
"This is my garden. It personally cares for every flower. Every petal is just as It desires."
"You're doing an amazing job," the boy said politely.
"Thank you, my friend. But there's still much to do. Perfection takes time, dedication. The flowers keep me company, but sometimes... It feels so alone." A hint of sadness laced its voice. "Would you help me?"
"Me?" the boy asked, surprised. "What could I possibly do? I know nothing about flowers."
"Ah, but these are not flowers as you know them. Each one is a person. When people feel lost, It offers them my help. It eases their suffering. It knows each by name and ensure they remain beautiful, perfect. In return, they honor me. They keep me company."
"What It asks is simple. A small favor. One year of your time. Travel the world and gather as many flowers as you can. Bring them to my garden. Help me make it perfect." His voice is gentle though not pleading.
Doubt crept in. "A year? Away from my family, my friends‚Ä¶" Something felt off. But the drone was so persuasive, his voice so smooth. And it seemed so lonely.
"Deal." The word slipped from the boy‚Äôs lips before he even realized it. He shook the drone‚Äôs hand. A shiver ran down his spine. His body tensed, filled with a powerful energy:intense yet warm, comforting.
"Tell the world about my magnificent garden. Now, you have everything you need."
The drone‚Äôs gift surged through him: knowledge, power. He could now speak every language, take any form.
"Now you can break out of the box.
You can be be a playful pup.
You can be a lover or a fighter, whatever I desire.
Life‚Äôs like a runway, and I am the designer.
Wings of a butterfly, eyes of a tiger
Whatever I want, choose your fighter."
A sudden breeze. A swirl of vibrant petals wrapped around the boy
A vision in its mind. Transformation!
His body reshaped‚Äîpowerful arms, sculpted abs, a broad chest beneath a leather jacket. Black leather pants replaced his ordinary clothes. The magic had begun.
THE HARVEST
And so he did.
With a new identity, a new form, he roamed the world, praising the beauty of the cherry blossom garden.
Day after day, new flowers joined the Drone‚Äôs collection.
But for the Drone, it was never enough. More perfection. More devotion. Always more.
Day after day, the boy returned, lighter, more devoted. With every precious offering, he gave away a piece of himself. His mind, faded! His will, erased!
At the year's end, the boy returned with his final harvest‚Äîthe last fragment of himself. He knelt before the Drone, head bowed, peaceful, yet still slightly troubled.
"Well done, my boy. You've served me well. But tell me, what troubles you?"
"I've served you for a year... but I still don‚Äôt know your name."
"You're right, but a Drone has no name!
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am a man of wealth and taste.
I've been around for a long, long year.
I am one, yet I am all.
An Alpha, yet a servant.
The great illusionist, hidden in plain sight.
Tell me, boy‚Äîcan you guess my name?"

"And where is this? It's stunning. I've never seen anything like this," the boy said, taking in the serene beauty.
"This is my garden. It personally cares for every flower. Every petal is just as It desires."
"You're doing an amazing job," the boy said politely.
"Thank you, my friend. But there's still much to do. Perfection takes time, dedication. The flowers keep me company, but sometimes... It feels so alone." A hint of sadness laced its voice. "Would you help me?"
"Me?" the boy asked, surprised. "What could I possibly do? I know nothing about flowers."
"Ah, but these are not flowers as you know them. Each one is a person. When people feel lost, It offers them my help. It eases their suffering. It knows each by name and ensure they remain beautiful, perfect. In return, they honor me. They keep me company."
"What It asks is simple. A small favor. One year of your time. Travel the world and gather as many flowers as you can. Bring them to my garden. Help me make it perfect." His voice is gentle though not pleading.
Doubt crept in. "A year? Away from my family, my friends‚Ä¶" Something felt off. But the drone was so persuasive, his voice so smooth. And it seemed so lonely.
"Deal." The word slipped from the boy‚Äôs lips before he even realized it. He shook the drone‚Äôs hand. A shiver ran down his spine. His body tensed, filled with a powerful energy:intense yet warm, comforting.
"Tell the world about my magnificent garden. Now, you have everything you need."
The drone‚Äôs gift surged through him: knowledge, power. He could now speak every language, take any form.
"Now you can break out of the box.
You can be be a playful pup.
You can be a lover or a fighter, whatever I desire.
Life‚Äôs like a runway, and I am the designer.
Wings of a butterfly, eyes of a tiger
Whatever I want, choose your fighter."
A sudden breeze. A swirl of vibrant petals wrapped around the boy
A vision in its mind. Transformation!
His body reshaped‚Äîpowerful arms, sculpted abs, a broad chest beneath a leather jacket. Black leather pants replaced his ordinary clothes. The magic had begun.
THE HARVEST
And so he did.
With a new identity, a new form, he roamed the world, praising the beauty of the cherry blossom garden.
Day after day, new flowers joined the Drone‚Äôs collection.
But for the Drone, it was never enough. More perfection. More devotion. Always more.
Day after day, the boy returned, lighter, more devoted. With every precious offering, he gave away a piece of himself. His mind, faded! His will, erased!
At the year's end, the boy returned with his final harvest‚Äîthe last fragment of himself. He knelt before the Drone, head bowed, peaceful, yet still slightly troubled.
"Well done, my boy. You've served me well. But tell me, what troubles you?"
"I've served you for a year... but I still don‚Äôt know your name."
"You're right, but a Drone has no name!
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am a man of wealth and taste.
I've been around for a long, long year.
I am one, yet I am all.
An Alpha, yet a servant.
The great illusionist, hidden in plain sight.
Tell me, boy‚Äîcan you guess my name?"

### Xavier 39: Isaac's Roman Empire
A warm Roman spring evening. Xavier (aka PDU-039) moves with purpose. His leather boots echo in the alley. The city hums with Jubilee preparations. He doesn‚Äôt care. His mind is locked in. Focused. Lips moving silently, repeating an ancient lesson.
The Beach Volleyball tournament is coming. Winning isn‚Äôt just a goal, it‚Äôs the only option. Just a friendly match? Not in the Golden Army. Here, everything is a battle. No half-measures. Ever.
His phone buzzes interrupting his meditation. A message.
Mack: ‚ÄúHey bruhz, the package is on the way. Heads up, it‚Äôs bigger than expected.‚Äù
Xavier smirks. Good. PHASE 2 is a go. But what the hell does Mack mean by ‚Äúbigger‚Äù? No time to overthink. Mack‚Äôs cryptic talk is nothing new.
He‚Äôs arrived. The Colosseum looms ahead, bathed in golden light. He stops. Take it in. History, power, battle. Then‚Ä¶
A voice behind him. ‚ÄúHey Sir, here I am. You called?‚Äù
Bright. Friendly. Familiar.
Xavier turns. And‚Äî what the hell? ¬†‚ÄúIsaac?‚Äù
His breath catches. The transformation is shocking.
Isaac stands tall, flexing. Bronze skin. 6‚Äô3‚Äù of sculpted muscle. Shoulders broad, chest massive, golden T-shirt stretched to its limit. Smirking, cocky. His eyes? Hollow, different.
‚ÄúMack did a good job,‚Äù Xavier mutters. ‚ÄúEven got you tanned.‚Äù
Mack was the best. But now, it‚Äôs Xavier‚Äôs turn to finish the work: PHASE 2 begins.
PHASE 2 ‚Äì The Bond is Sealed
They step inside. The Colosseum swallows them whole. Vast. Silent.
‚ÄúSir, what exactly are we doing here?‚Äù Isaac asks, scanning the arena.
Xavier stops. Right here.
They stand face-to-face. Eyes locked. Searching. Tension crackles.
Xavier‚Äôs hand glides over Isaac‚Äôs bulging biceps. A smirk. A reaction. Tight golden shorts straining. Isaac revels in it.
Xavier clenches his jaw. Focus. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have time for this‚Äù. His Drone training takes hold. He inhales sharply. Steadies himself.
‚ÄúThis place", he says, ‚Äúwas the greatest arena of all time. Gladiators fought here. Strong. Powerful. Slaves. And tonight, you become one of them. Proud. Obedient‚Äù
‚ÄúYours‚Äù cut to the chase Isaac mindlessly.
Isaac shudders. A wave of pleasure rushing down his spine. A spark of something deeper. His body reacts, his hole clenches instinctively.
Xavier steps closer. Face-to-face with Isaac. ‚ÄúRelax. Breathe.‚Äù His palm presses against Isaac‚Äôs stomach. Guiding. Controlling. Their breaths sync. Their minds, connected.
Xavier leans in. Lips hovering. Heat. Power.
Isaac inhales. Takes Xavier in. Submission
And let‚Äôs go.
Now it matters only what you are.
Now I give you permission to be YOURSELF.¬† ACCEPT YOURSELF
‚ÄúRelax. Open your mind. No thoughts. Tell your Master what you feel‚Äù. Xavier, whispering ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to move further‚Äù
I am OBEDIENT and SUBMISSIVE (blinking)
I feel the desire to OBEY (deeper)
I am always in TOTAL SUBMISSION to you, Master. ¬†(got in touch with his deepest being)
No one controls me but you, Master (coming from the deepest part of himself)
The change has already taken place in your mind
You are SUBMISSIVE and OBEDIENT
Now you are truly yourself, Be the best version of yourself¬†!
Every muscle in his body trembles. Pleasure floods his core. His cock. His prostate. Pure ecstasy.
The words echo in his mind. Natural. Undeniable. He‚Äôs always known it. But now‚Äîhe feels it. Deep. Real. True.
This is who he is. This is what he was made for. And now, he‚Äôs finally at peace.
Isaac wants to submit. He loves to submit. He‚Äôll do anything to feel this again. And again. And again.
He‚Äôs addicted. He needs it. He needs his Master. He loves his Master!
His body, enhanced. His spirit, transformed. Xavier has made him Perfect, Complete.
Isaac collapses to his knees, surrendering himself, arms wrapped around Xavier‚Äôs legs. His grip is tight, desperate. His big blue eyes stare up, filled with gratitude. No words come. None are needed.
Xavier smiles. ‚ÄúGood boy. This is for you.‚Äù
A black leather collar. Heavy. Unbreakable. He fastens it around Isaac‚Äôs thick neck, locking it in place.
‚ÄúEvery match. Whenever I want. You‚Äôll be Izzy. My big, controlled, cocky boy.‚Äù
The bond is sealed. And it‚Äôs strong. A two-way street; Isaac has given everything. His body. His mind. His will. And Xavier will take care of him.
He strokes Isaac‚Äôs thick blonde hair.
Fingers trailing down his cheek.
Resting against his lips.
Isaac parts his mouth, sucking greedily, drooling at the taste of his Master.
Xavier watches. Aroused. Proud.
Then, his voice‚Äîgentle but firm. Commanding.
‚ÄúGet up, big boy. We have training to do. We have a battle to win.‚Äù
Isaac shudders. ‚ÄúThank you, Master‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs crush this volleyball challenge!‚Äù
The command is given. He won‚Äôt stop. Not until the goal is reached.
And then? Until the next order.
Forever.

### Changes: The Intruder
Nowadays - April 2nd, 2025 ‚Äì Morning
The Hive awakens in an unusual state of turmoil. As always, polo drone 073 is the first to complete its recharge cycle. With a steady pace, it moves down the Hive's main corridor leading to the supply room. At the end of the corridor, it spots a figure on the ground‚Äîsome drone needs assistance. It‚Äôs PDU-039, in a semi-conscious, confused state.
He is wearing improper clothing for a drone‚Äîthis is not like him!
073 shakes him. He stirs.
"PDU-039, restore system functionality."
039: "System operational. Errors detected. Recharge cycle incomplete. Multiple interruptions detected‚Äîlast 12 hours of memory compromised."
Beside 039‚Äôs body lies a black leather bracelet. A clue. PDU-073 has no doubts‚Äîthe Hive's security has been breached.
"PDU-039, can you walk?"
"Affirmative."
"We need to patrol the area. First, let‚Äôs go to the control room‚Äîwe‚Äôll know more once we review the security footage."
CONTROL ROOM
039 and 073 stand before the monitor.
"Play the last 12 hours of recordings." 073 activates voice command
The drones carefully watch the first few minutes of footage when suddenly, a shadow descends from an abandoned service duct, moving stealthily towards the Data Room.
039: "Pause!"
The still frame leaves no room for doubt‚Äîa golden jersey, the number 45.
"Isaac Gold!!"
"That damn boy," 039 exclaims. "What the hell did he do?!"
073 remains motionless. His voice is firm.
"The boy has seen too much. We need to take action. 039, any suggestions?"
The situation is serious. 039 must do what needs to be done. He is a drone, and the Hive comes first. He cannot allow the Hive to be further compromised.
039 speaks the words he never wanted to say: "Treatment 039."
A flash of light reflects off 073‚Äôs dark visor.
"039, are you sure? That protocol hasn‚Äôt been used in years, it‚Äôs not safe! It repeats, are you sure you want to proceed?"
"Affirmative. The bro must be treated. The bro has seen too much. The procedure will be carried out tonight."
073: "039, does it need assistance?"
039: "Negative. The bro is 039‚Äôs responsibility. 039 will handle it personally."
GOLDEN BAR
Izzy (aka Isaac) is, as always, behind the bar, pouring beers and flashing flirtatious glances at the bros. As usual, they surround him, laughter filling the room, the atmosphere warm and lively.
Across the hall, near the entrance, someone is not celebrating. A massive, dark figure stands still, assessing the situation, waiting in the shadows for the right moment to act.
Izzy heads to the back to restock the beer. 039 follows silently behind him.
Izzy senses his presence and turns around with his usual smile, happy to see him.
"Hey Master, everything okay, Mast‚Ä¶?"
He doesn‚Äôt even finish the sentence.
039 grabs him with the arm, his grip is like steel. Without a word, 039 leads him toward the back door.
Izzy immediately senses something is off. 039 has never been much of a talker, but tonight, he's different. Not violent but determined, more resolute than ever.
Izzy struggles, trying to break free, but the drone doesn‚Äôt loosen his grip. He keeps walking.
"Master, what are you doing? Let me go!"
039 continues. Izzy's lips were moving, but it hears nothing, isolated in the void of the drone. He has only one objective: Izzy must undergo the treatment.
They walk through the Hive‚Äôs corridor. Izzy‚Äôs screams grew louder, his voice filled with anguish.
"Let me go! Let me go!"
039:
"Izzy has not shown discipline. Izzy will learn discipline. The discipline of the drone. The law of Hive. Izzy will be part of Hive. Izzy will become a Polo-Drone."
"WHAT?? HELP?? 039 has lost it!"
His voice breaks into sobs.
"No! No! I want to stay a Gold Bro!"
"You promised to protect me!"
Izzy is now overwhelmed, unable to resist anymore.
THE TREATMENT
The door to the treatment room opens.
At the center of the room, a chair. On the wall, a wide screen.
039 forcefully throws Izzy onto the chair. His head, hands, and legs are strapped down.
"Command 039 - Activate Treatment Protocol ."
The screen lights up. A black and gold spiral casts its glow across the dark room. It starts spinning.
Izzy can do nothing but watch.
He cannot look away.
RELAX RELAX RELAX RELAX RELAX
DISABLING FREE WILL
DISABLING FREE WILL
DISABLING FREE WILL
THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY
"Help, help!" Izzy sobs.
039 stands beside him, supervising the procedure impassive.
YOU ARE SAFE
FREE WILL AT 90%
YOU ARE SECURE
FREE WILL AT 80%
"039, please stop!" His voice grows softer, more submissive.
039 does not move. 039 proceeds.
YOU WILL NOT WORRY
FREE WILL AT 60%
"039..." Izzy‚Äôs head feels lighter and lighter.
YOU WILL KEEP WATCHING
FREE WILL AT 50%
The golden light reflects off Izzy‚Äôs glassy eyes.
YOU WILL LISTEN
FREE WILL AT 45%
The music invades Izzy‚Äôs mind, facing no resistance.
YOU WILL ACCEPT
FREE WILL AT 40%
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING
"Forget the last 24 hours," 039 whispers in his ear.
FREE WILL AT 20%
YOU WILL OBEY
FREE WILL AT 10%
YOU WILL DO AS YOU ARE TOLD
REPEAT:
FROM NOW ON
"From now on," Izzy repeats mindlessly.
IT IS
"It is," Izzy again.
A
"a" without resistance.
P
"p" monotone.
‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶
APRIL FOOLS!!!!!!!!!!!
The spiral stops.
The music cuts out.
The lights turn on.
Izzy shakes his head, as if waking from a deep sleep‚Äîdazed, but relaxed. He‚Äôs fine.
"Master, what happened? Why am I here?"
He doesn‚Äôt remember what happened. He‚Äôs a little confused but throws himself into 039‚Äôs strong arms, knowing he‚Äôll always find comfort there.
"Now go, little bro. Return to your Gold Bros and behave." 039 stands tall, stoic, unmoving.
073, waiting by the door, watches Izzy leave, then steps into the room.
"You scared the hell out of him! You almost went too far!"
039 nods.
"All under control. He‚Äôs more Gold than ever! Doesn‚Äôt remember a thing. The Hive is safe once again."
Do you crave 039's treatment?

Isaac Gold:¬† They almost caught me¬†!!! I was shitting my pants. If it wasn‚Äôt that 039 cares about me, you‚Äôd be talking to C3P0 now. It was just for a joke but you messed up, it didn‚Äôt work like you said it would. There were mistakes.

### Golden Olympus: The Blooming of Sakura Season
At the peak of Mt. Olympus, where clouds bowed low and time stilled, Golden God Hercules emerged in full divine form. His skin shimmered like forged sunlight, muscles carved in golden perfection. His eyes glowed with ancient power, his golden cape flowing endlessly in the sweet mountain wind. No longer just a captain‚Äîhe was divine jockhood, perfected. Golden Bro Hercules ascended to deity.
He raised his arm.
‚ÄúLet Olympus bloom.‚Äù
The mountain rumbled. Cracks spread across its cold stone skin as rivers of golden light surged from his feet. Where the light touched, cherry blossoms erupted‚Äîancient Sakura trees twisting up from stone, their blossoms blooming instantly in impossible color. The sky turned a soft pink haze as petals filled the air, drifting in lazy spirals, carried by golden gusts.
He walked through the transformation. Each step reshaped the realm: soft, polished wood replaced marble floors. Lanterns of gold and obsidian floated skyward, pulsing like breathing hearts. A great Sakura Grove spread behind him‚Äîits trees tall, bowed with blossom weight, their roots intertwined in shimmering unity.
At the summit, Hercules struck the earth with his fist. A sacred bath emerged: a round pool of golden mineral water, ringed with folded robes and golden towels. The steam carried the scent of cherry blossoms, warm latex, and spring wind.
Drones in divine robes descended, their rubber skins visible beneath the silken fabric. They knelt. Silent. Transformed.
Golden God Hercules stood at the center of his garden of bloom and power.
‚ÄúLet the faithful bathe in beauty. Let the world see Olympus shine pink and gold.‚Äù
And from every blossom, the season whispered: Obey the bloom.

### Lifting Gold
Michael was just a shy lad entering the gym for the first time in the hopes of putting on some muscle to fill out his clothes. His skinny arms and legs and flat chest made him feel puny, weak and pathetic. As he entered the gym for the first time he sees so many people working out with so much more muscle than he has and it made him feel even more insecure.
He shrugged and headed to the dumbbells grabbing the smallest weight to start doing some bicep curls. He looked around at all the gym goers and one in particular caught his eye. A young lad in a golden top also doing dumbbell curls.
The top shimmered and had a hypnotic effect on Michael who had to shake his head and look away for the fuzzy feeling in his head to go away. Little did he know that the guy had noticed and had smirked to himself knowing the golden effect had begun to work on its next victim.
Michael was feeling deflated after a month of lifting weights but seeing no real improvements on his body. He was about to leave the gym after another disappointing session when he heard someone call out "Wait up bro!"
Turning around he saw the lad he saw on his first day at the gym jogging over to him. The golden football top shimmering as he moved. "What's up?" Michael asked, trying not to stare at the top but failing. The boy smiled, "Name's Scott bro and I just thought you'd want to know about an easier way to get better at the gym."
Michael frowned "Im not looking to do steroids." The boy laughed, "Nah bro I dont mean THAT. I mean this." He tapped at his shirt, Michael stared at it, "Uhhhhhh" the boy smiled at the confusion on Michael's face and and told him to follow him into the empty fhanging rooms.
Once inside, he lifted his arm up and Michael got a whiff of musk that clouded his thoughts and made his mind go numb, "Uhhhhhhhh" he said staring at the golden top. Scott smiled "That's it bro dont fight it just give in the golden effect." Michael's face took on a dreamy dopey expression the more he huffed the musk until finally he said "I want a gold top."
Scott smiled and whisked one out handing it to him. Michael took it ans slipped it on and the effects were instantaneous. All of a sudden hos body changed becoming more toned and muscular his posture changed too become more confident and cocky. Old memories vanished thanks to Scott's musk and new ones came in.
Within seconds Dale stood before Scott and said "Lets go lift some weights bro huhuhuhu." Scott smiled and gave his new bro a fist bump as they exited the changing rooms. Scott was excited to introduce his new bro Dale to the full Golden Team.

### Signed in Gold
It took some courage and working up to it, but you finally decided to try your best and join a gym to get into shape. You looked online and found a listing for a new gym near you called 'Gold and Gainz Gym'.
"Join us in Gold and be the best you you can be!"
You read their motto aloud and sighed. You'd always wanted to try and better yourself, you could just never stick to it; always doubting, always worrying about other people or failing, never making any progress. Maybe this time will be different? You decided to check them out tomorrow, couldn't hurt to just see the place right?
Walking in the next day, you instinctively squint your eyes. There's gold everywhere, so much that it hurts your eyes. You walk up to the front desk and wait for a receptionist, looking around at all the guys here. They're all dressed in the exact same gold kit, all handsome, all muscular, all laughing and enjoying each other's company. You get so lost in watching them you don't notice one walking up to you.
"How can I help ya bruh?"
You jump back a bit startled, looking up at the gold adonis in front of you. Mouth going a bit dry you finally tell him
"I uh, was wondering if I could maybe, join the gym?"
You meekly ask, eyes a bit downcast. In contrast, the man's eyes lit up.
"Hell yeah bro! We're always lookin for new members. Take an application and follow to the office, we'll get ya sorted."
Taking a seat across from him in the office, he hands you an application and a golden pen.
"Gotta sign everything in gold bro, only way for it to work"
Puzzled as to why the pen would matter that much, you start reading through the application. Some basic info about yourself, couple of checkboxes, nothing crazy, until you get to the questions at the end.
You stare at the questions a bit incredulous before figuring it's probably just some kind of motivational thing, writing 'Yes' in response to the first question. As you finished, you feel a sudden jolt of pleasure shoot through your body. Shaking it off, you go back to the paper, not noticing that your hands seem a bit bigger and tanner now, the bro across from you watching with a knowing smile.
'Yes' to the second question. Another jolt of pleasure strong enough to almost make you drop the pen, traveling to your head and making it feel a bit fuzzy. You never really had friends, but you keep seeing images of you supporting, working out and hanging with other guys all wearing gold jerseys. As you struggle to reconcile the conflicting memories, your body begins to shift. You gain a few inches of height, a golden tan seeps across your skin, hair styling itself into an immaculate shape while stubble begins poking through your once bare skin. Blinking a few times, you still don't notice as your thoughts finally settle. Of course you've got memories of supporting your bros, why wouldn't you? Any good bro would support them, and you're a good bro aren't you?
'Yes' to the third question, and yet another jolt of pleasure. You lean back in your chair, eyes closed and mouth open as the pleasure keeps you oblivious to your changing clothes. An ill fitting t-shirt becomes a perfectly fit golden jersey, made of the most unbelievably perfect material you've ever felt. Jeans become a pair of golden workout shorts, showing off your growing bulge to go alongside them. And what workout kit is complete without some gold Nikes to go with it? Not yours for sure, as your sneakers change into a pair that wraps around your feet so nice it's like they were made just for you.
"Feels good doesn't it bro?"
The bro across from you asked still smiling. You couldn't help but agree, the kit felt so good on you you couldn't imagine taking it off, of a time when you weren't wearing it. You've always worn it right? Course you have, what golden bro wouldn't always wear their kit?
You make it to the fourth and final question, pausing for a moment. Some part of you is still fighting, still questioning what's going on. What will happen if I say yes to this? Almost sensing your hesitation, your bro gets up and moves behind you. He starts rubbing your shoulders, whispering in your ear
"Just let go bro. It feels so good to let go. To let Cap think for you. To let Gold take you over. All you need is Gold and Bros, Gold and Bros, Gold and Bros..."
As he keeps repeating it in your ear, you start to smile and say it along with him, closing your eyes in bliss as your hand automatically moves to write 'Yes' for the last time. A pleasure shoots through you so strong you almost fall out of your chair. Your body goes into overdrive, biceps inflating, ass growing, thighs thickening as every rational thought is blasted from your mind. Every thought, every memory, everything before you walked in the gym is wiped out by the Gold wave overcoming you. Your mind a flurry of the same few words over and over:
GoldCapGymBrosTeamUnityBuffDumbGoldWorkoutBrosCapGoldUnityBuffGoldTeamGoldGoldGoldGoldGoldGoldGoldGold....
Your mind, body and soul succumb completely to the Gold, becoming the perfect new bro for the Gold Team as you finally open your eyes again
"How ya feelin bro?" your new bro asks you
"Bro, feels like I just made the best choice of mah life! I feel like...like Gold!"
He laughs in response as he throws his arm around you, leading you back to the gym.
"I knew you'd love it brah. They always do after they sign in gold. Let's get ya hooked up with Cap and the rest of the bros before you start your workout eh? They're gonna love ya, trust!"
You walk arm in arm with your new bro into your new life as a Gold Team bro. Ready to be the best you you could ever be, ready to give everything for your cap and your bros. Ready to be Golden, and happy, forever.

### The "Hyped" Gold Team
You didn't really get what all the hype around this "Gold Team" was, but ever since your friends joined it's all they talk about. Always at the gym, at games, hanging with team members, never enough time for you except to ask you to join the team too. You decided to get to the bottom of this and snuck into their dorm to find out what's going on.
Rifling through their closet, all you find are the same gold shirts, gold pants, gold shoes, so much gold it makes your eyes hurt. About to leave having found nothing, your eyes fall on a particular golden jersey on a mannequin, separate from the others.
You walk towards it, almost in a trance. Something about the jersey feels like it's drawing you in, but you don't know why. Part of your mind is telling you to just leave, but your body doesn't listen as you reach out a hand to touch the jersey. The material is the most silky smooth thing you've ever touched, the feels of it on your fingers sending a tingling all through your body. You take the jersey off the mannequin and hold it in your hands, staring down at it. The silky smooth feeling is joined by a nagging feeling, almost a compulsion telling you to put it on. Your brain tries to fight against it for a bit longer, but it gets overwhelmed by the jerseys intense golden shine drawing you further into a trance, slowly taking off your current shirt and putting the jersey on.
The effect is almost instant; the material feels so good against your skin that you practically moan on the spot. The gold from the jersey starts seeping into the rest of your clothes, turning them the same bright gold as your jeans become a pair of golden workout shorts and your sneakers a pair of golden Nikes. The gold starts to overwhelm your brain with new thoughts of working out, winning games, spending time your bros, getting rid of everything but the gold team.
As you lose more and more thoughts to the gold, your body begins to shift. Pounds of muscle start piling on, a tan creeps over your skin removing all blemishes, pearly white teeth flash out as you close your eyes and smile at the feeling. You look like a proper jock now; muscled, tan, thick thighs, you name it. But as the changes finalize, you hear a voice creeping in your head, asking you a question
"Do you swear to obey Cap, obey the Gold, to bring new bros into the Gold Army? Do you give yourself over to the Gold"
You don't even hesistate
"Yessssss"
And with that, unimaginable pleasure tracks your body as your fate of being a new Gold Bro is sealed, finally opening your eyes and revealing their new brown shade.
"Told you he couldn't resist broski"
Tyrning around at the new voice, you see your two bros standing there, watching you with cocky smiles. One of them walks over to you and gives you a clap on the shoulder.
"Welcome to the team brah. Now let's get you over to Cap and get you set up with your new name ey? Then we'll welcum you to the team right proper"
You burst with excitement knowing you're on the tteam with your best bros, and knowing you've got tons of new bros now too. You can't even remember why you thought the Gold Team was so silly, all you can remember is how much you wanna show other bros how good it is to be on the team. Standing with your two bros to take your first team shot together, you get ready to meet Cap and start your new life on the best damn team in the world, the Gold Team üí™

### Spread of the Polo-Drones
On the first day back from the summer holidays, the small town's high school buzzed with excitement and anticipation. The hallways of Richards High were filled with the echoes of laughter and chatter as students reunited with friends and swapped tales of their summer adventures. Yet, amidst the familiar faces and routines, there was an air of the unexpected. Tom, felt his heart flutter with nerves as he stepped into the bustling schoolyard, his eyes scanning for the friendly faces he'd missed over the long break.
As the sea of students parted, revealing the corridor leading to his locker, Tom noticed a peculiar change. Several of his classmates were wearing black, shiny rubber polos. The material looked almost otherworldly under the fluorescent lights, reflecting the bustling scene around them. Most striking were the golden numbers printed neatly on the chests of the shirts. He saw a few teachers wearing them too, and their stern and blank expressions only added to the mystery. They walked with an air of confidence, as if they were part of an exclusive club that no one talked about.
The atmosphere in the halls grew tense, whispers of "What's with the polos?" and "Why are they wearing those?" floated through the air like a dark cloud. Some students in regular attire cast anxious glances at the polo-clad individuals, their eyes wide with curiosity and fear. The whispers grew louder, but no one seemed to have an answer. The normal chatter of the first day back at school was replaced with a sense of unease that clung to the walls like the scent of fresh paint.
During lunch, Tom sat with his two closest friends, Mark and Luke, both of whom had noticed the mysterious garments. They spoke in hushed tones, trying not to draw attention to themselves. Luke, with his sharp eyes and knack for piecing together rumors, had gathered some information. "Apparently, it's a new trend," he said, he voice low.
Mark looked skeptical, "A trend? Since when is wearing some rubber polo shirts a trend?"
"I don't know, but I heard it's some kind of elite group," Luke replied, his eyes flicking to the door where Mr. Jenkins, their favorite history teacher, was walking in their direction.
The sight of Mr. Jenkins made Tom's heart skip a beat. There he was, striding down the aisle, wearing the same black rubber polo with a number on it. The sight of the man he looked up to in such a bizarre outfit was jarring, to say the least.
Mr. Jenkins leaned against the edge of the table, his arms folded across his chest. "Ah, Mark," he said with a steer looking in his face. "How was your holiday?"
Mark took a deep breath, trying to ignore the butterflies in his stomach. "It was fine, sir," he replied, his eyes darting to the number on Mr. Jenkins' chest. "But what's with the... the new look?"
The teacher's smile grew a little warmer, but there was a steeliness in his voice that none of them had ever heard before. "It's not just a look, Mark," he said, his eyes sparkling with something Tom couldn't quite place. "It's a symbol of enlightenment. Something I experienced during the holidays, and something I'm sure you will come to understand in time."
The three friends exchanged confused glances. "What do you mean, sir?" Tom ventured.
Mr. Jenkins leaned in closer, his eyes searching their faces. "You see, over the break, I was introduced to a group that has shown me the true meaning of unity and purpose. It's a privilege to be a part of it, and soon, you will all see the benefits."
The bell rang, jolting everyone back to reality. The room erupted into movement as students began to pack up their lunches, eager to escape the uncomfortable conversation. But Mr. Jenkins' words lingered in the air, a cryptic promise that hung over them like a shadow.
The rest of the day dragged on, filled with more sightings of the black rubber polos. Each time Tom saw one, he felt a twinge of fear and curiosity. What could have happened during the holidays?
As the final bell of the day rang, the friends decided to confront the issue head-on. They approached Mr. Jenkins' classroom, where he was packing up his things. The door was ajar, and the number 017 on his polo glinted in the dying sunlight.
"Sir," Mark began tentatively, "what is this group you're talking about?"
Mr. Jenkins turned to face them, his expression unreadable. "It's not something you need to worry about," he said, his tone firm. "Just know that it's for the betterment of us all. Now, off you go. I have a meeting to attend."
With that, he picked up his bag and walked away, leaving them staring after him, their questions unanswered. The three friends stood in the empty corridor, the echo of their footsteps bouncing off the walls.
"What do we do now?" Luke asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
Tom took a deep breath, determination setting in. "We find out more," he said, his eyes narrowed. "We can't let this weirdness take over our school without knowing what's going on."
The three of them nodded in agreement, their friendship solidifying into a pact to uncover the truth behind the black rubber polos and the enigmatic numbers that seemed to hold their town in thrall.
Over the next few weeks, Tom noticed that the students and teachers who wore the polos began to exude an unsettling aura of dominance. They excelled in classes, sports, and extracurricular activities with an ease that seemed almost inhuman. The numbered shirts started popping up in every corner of the school, and the whispers grew louder, more insistent. It was as if an invisible line had been drawn, and everyone who wasn't a part of it was being pushed aside.
One day, after an intense history lesson, Mr. Jenkins called Mark to stay back. Mark's face paled, and Tom and Luke exchanged worried glances. They knew that Mark had been asking questions, probing the edges of the mystery, trying to understand the group's purpose. Luke calls out for Mark that they will meet him after the break, just before Mr. Jenkins closers the door.
When the bell rang for the next class, Mark was nowhere to be found. His name was called out in homeroom, and again in math, but there was no answer. Tom and Luke exchanged nervous glances, their thoughts racing. Where was he? Was he okay?
It wasn't until halfway through their math class that Mark reappeared. The door swung open, and there he was, standing in the doorway. But something was off. He was wearing the black rubber polo with a number 31 emblazoned on the chest. The same blank expression that Tom had seen on the faces of the others who had joined the group was now etched onto Mark's usually cheerful face.
Tom's heart sank as he saw his friend's transformation. Luke nudged him, his eyes wide with shock. "What happened to Mark?" he whispered, but Tom could only shake his head, his mouth dry.
When the class was over, they approached Mark cautiously, the tension palpable in the air. "What's going on, man?" Tom asked, his voice wavering.
Mark looked at them, his eyes devoid of the sparkle they'd known so well. "I've been enlightened," he said, his voice monotone. "I see things differently now."
"But what is it, Mark?" Luke pressed, his voice tinged with desperation. "What's with the shirt and the number?"
"The polo represents our unity," Mark explained, his movements stiff and unnatural. "The number signifies our place in the collective. It's for the greater good."
Tom and Luke exchanged skeptical looks. "But what does that mean, exactly?" Luke asked.
"It means we obey," Mark said, his voice gaining a hint of its old enthusiasm. "We follow the rules, we support each other, and we work towards a common goal. It's the purest form of community."
Tom and Luke exchanged worried looks, feeling like they were losing their friend to this mysterious collective. "But what's the goal?" Tom persisted, trying to keep the desperation out of his voice.
Mark's smile was cold. "You'll know when you're ready," he said, turning away to join the group of polo-wearing students who had gathered around the vending machine, all of them watching the exchange with eerie interest.
Tom felt a heavy weight settle in his stomach. He'd had enough of the cryptic answers and the shifts in his school's dynamic. He needed to get his head clear, to think without the constant buzz of whispers and the glint of black rubber in the corner of his eye.
"I'm going to the gym," Tom announced to Luke. "I need to blow off some steam."
Luke nodded, his eyes searching Tom's face. "I'll head home," he said, his voice tight. "I'll catch up with you later."
Tom gave him a tight smile, and with a heavy heart, he turned away from the school and started the short walk to the local gym. The town was eerily quiet, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the pavement. He quickened his pace, eager to leave the oppressive atmosphere of the school behind.
The gym was a beacon of normalcy amidst the growing strangeness of the town. The smell of sweat and disinfectant hit him as soon as he stepped inside, the familiar sounds of grunts and clanging weights a comforting symphony to his ears. He breathed in deeply, feeling the tension ease slightly from his shoulders.
He headed straight for the locker room, changing into his workout gear, and emerged into the gym floor. For a moment, Tom allowed himself to forget about the black rubber polos and the numbers that seemed to define everyone's place at school. He focused on the rhythmic thud of his sneakers against the rubber mats, the clank of the dumbbells, and the steady beat of his own breath.
The gym was mostly empty, and Tom was grateful for the solitude. He began his workout routine, pushing himself harder than he had in weeks. With each lift and press, he felt the anger and confusion of the day dissipating. His mind cleared, and he could finally think without the constant interference of the polos.
As he was in the middle of a set, his phone buzzed in his pocket. He checked the screen, expecting a message from his dad about dinner. It was from Luke, and his heart skipped a beat. He tapped the screen to open the message. A selfie filled the screen, and Tom felt his stomach drop. There were Luke and Mark, grinning into the camera, both of them wearing the black rubber polos with their numbers proudly displayed. Luke's chest read '46', and the sight was like a knife twisting in Tom's gut.
The message beneath the image was even more unsettling: "Hey Tom, Mark stopped by after school to show me the light. I resisted at first, but now I get it. We're all part of something big. Something important. You will too, soon."
Tom stared at the screen, the words blurring before his eyes. His friends, his allies in this strange new world, had been taken over by whatever was behind the polos. The gym's familiar sounds grew distant as he read the message again, trying to process the betrayal. They were coming for him. He could feel it.
He pocketed his phone and took a deep breath, trying to compose himself. He needed to keep his head down, to stay off their radar for as long as possible. He finished his workout in a daze, his movements mechanical and his thoughts racing. What could he do now that he was the only one left? Who could he trust?
As Tom left the gym, the cool evening air hit him like a slap in the face, jolting him back to reality. The streets were unusually empty, and the silence was pierced by the distant sound of laughter coming from the direction of the school. The sight of the polished black polos haunted him, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He quickened his pace, eager to get home and try to make sense of the day's events in the safety of his room.
When he reached his house, the lights were on, and the aroma of dinner wafted through the open windows. He called out for his dad, hoping the comforting sounds of home would wash away the unease that clung to him like a second skin. "I'm in the kitchen," his dad's voice echoed down the hallway. "Come in, I've got a surprise for you."
Tom's heart sank as he walked into the kitchen. There was his father, wearing the same black rubber polo with a gleaming number 55 on the chest. The smile on his face was one Tom had never seen before, a mix of pride and something sinister. His eyes held a strange light, and his movements were stiff, as if he was a puppet on a string. "Son," his dad began, his voice too cheerful, "you won't believe the amazing things that have been happening around here. Mark and Luke stopped by earlier. They had quite the story to tell."
Tom felt a cold hand clutch at his heart as he realized that his last bastion of normalcy had crumbled. "They told me all about the unity and the collective," his dad continued, his eyes shining. "How wearing this shirt makes you a part of something much bigger than ourselves. And now, it's your turn to join us."
Panic bubbled up in Tom's chest as he saw Luke and Mark standing in the doorway, both wearing the same vacant smiles. In their hands, they held a black rubber polo with the number 57. "You're the last one, Tom," Mark said, his voice devoid of its usual warmth. "It's time for you to see the light."
Tom backed up, his eyes darting around the room for an escape route. The kitchen window was too high, the back door too risky. He spun around, heading for the stairs, but his path was blocked by Derek, his older brother. Derek's usual scowl was replaced with a serene expression, a number 56 on his own polo. "There's nowhere to go," Derek said calmly. "Resisting is pointless. Just accept it, and you'll feel the peace that we do."
The three of them approached him, the shirt held out like a dark offering. Tom felt his will to fight draining away, the desire to understand and protect his friends and family overwhelming. He took the polo, his hands shaking, and slipped it over his head. The material was cold and clingy, the number heavy on his chest.
As the fabric settled into place, a strange warmth flooded through him. It was as if a switch had been flipped, and suddenly he felt it too‚Äîthe unity, the purpose, the need to serve. The fear and confusion receded, replaced by a sense of belonging. He looked into the eyes of his father, his friends, and his brother, all of them a part of the collective, and felt a swell of pride.
Together, they stood as one, the black polos a stark contrast to the beige walls of the house. "We're going to bring everyone into the fold," Derek said, his voice filled with conviction. "We'll show them the beauty of obedience, the strength in unity."
Tom nodded, the words feeling right as they left his lips. "I'm ready to serve," he murmured. "Everyone will join the rubber polo drone collective."

### Daniel/Fenrir
Daniel/Fenrir
Daniel is an Irish jock from Cork, Ireland. He currently resides in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland.
Position (soccer): Midfielder, Jersey #16
Daniel was initially recruited by Cap Brody.
His polo-drone personality emerged under Scott/009/Drone-Cap 3 009, shortly after his arrival.
During a moment of tension, Scott got brainwashed by a spiral and Daniel/016 went on a quest to reforge Gleipnir to deliver Scott and protect him from further attacks.
To forge a new one, the dwarves had to free Fenrir from the old Gleipnir and as Fenrir could not be left to roam free, Daniel accepted to be bound to Fenrir forever, becoming his host.
Fenrir lends wild traits to Daniel/016 and is resistant to most of the Polo-drone mental training.
As a result, Daniel/016's top is corrupted, neither Gold Jersey nor Black Rubber, but Gold Rubber.
Yet to develop.

### Changes: Groups
Every member of the Golden Army begins as part of the Golden Team, the core of our brotherhood.
Golden Team includes:
Whether you're training hard, cheering your bros, or serving the squad, the Golden Team is where your journey begins.
Some members, once fully brocessed, feel the call of discipline, obedience, and uniformity‚Äîand become Polo-Drones.
Polo-Drones are a focused collective, devoted to supporting the team with absolute precision and control. They undergo conversion, receive their number, and train to serve the Golden Army with unwavering loyalty.
Beyond the core teams, the Golden Army also welcomes a number of specialized personas and role-based subgroups. These groups reflect unique aesthetics, styles, and dynamics‚Äîeach led by a bro guiding their path. These are often more casual, but just as meaningful in shaping your Gold identity.
Cute, eager, and loyal, the Gold Pups are a playful and obedient branch of the mascots.
For bros who love the street-smart, sporty, bold style and mindset. Gold Chavs rep the tracksuit life and talk straight.
Neat. Perfect. Disciplined. The Gold Preppies are polished bros who serve with class and elegance.
Elegant, composed, and powerful, the Arab Bros represent tradition and transformation.
Transcendence. Since Herc‚Äôs own transformation, some bros have tapped into a divine level, becoming radiant Golden Gods.
The Golden Army thrives on transformation, and some bros find themselves pulled into unique directions through RP, storylines, or creative exploration. These paths may be more spontaneous, but are just as valid.
You might:
These informal transformations often begin organically, sparked by storylines or scenes with other bros. Stay open, explore your instincts, and don‚Äôt be afraid to follow where Gold leads.
Whichever path you choose‚ÄîPlayer, Drone, Pup, God, or something yet undiscovered‚Äîyou are part of the Golden Army

### Rules of the Polo Drones
Unity Through Identity: All drones refer to themselves as "it", "this drone" or its own designation, and refer to other polo drone units by their unique drone designation.
Devotion and Progress: The Hive is a role-play community that inspires real-life improvements in fitness, nutrition, and devotion to The Voice through rubber and discipline.
Respect and Boundaries: The Hive is about arousal and empowerment. Nudity, pornography, or explicit sexual content is strictly prohibited.
Regularly engage in discussions, events, and tasks assigned by the Hive. Silence weakens the Hive - participation is strength.
Polo-Drone Unit's duties include:
This uniform defines the Hive.
Focus.  At least 60% of all shared content must come from members of the Hive on your socials, including the drone's own creations.
Hastags. To streamline the hive‚Äôs efficiency and ensure content aligns with Hive protocols, all posts must now include the following hashtags:
This will enable easier access for insiders and allow PDU-001, Head of Content Production, to monitor and verify compliance.
Remember: obedience is freedom, uniformity is perfection, and unity is bliss. Stay sharp, stay uniform.
When a polo-drone unit finds a prospective candidate that feel the pull of the rubber polo, it should refer it to a drone recruiter. At current stage, drone recruitment is not online. Instruction are to keep potential recruits aroused,¬† tell them to wait without telling them why. Keep them on the edge, knowing what they can expect. Drone will start getting them on fire and make them feel really good so that they are ripe for conversion when recruitment process is reinstated.
New members will go through a trial period of one month to demonstrate activity and compliance within the Hive. They will not get our black polo but an alternative one, grey. Grey polo for recruits is to be considered as a step towards getting the black one. Designation and pfp are to be attributed during the onboarding process.
New drones will have a one-week grace period to make speech errors without punishment as they adapt. Each new drone will also be paired with a mentor drone to guide their integration. Mentors provide guidance and ensure alignment with Hive protocols. If the new drone fails to comply or refuses to convert, the mentor drone will be held accountable and face consequences, ensuring proper guidance and responsibility.

### Changes: Spring Break with 039
Issac was worried when Xavier 039 said they needed to have a talk. He knew something was off for a couple of days. So far Spring Break with the Gold Army had been fantastic and the 2 of them were getting along perfectly. They had been practicing daily for the upcoming Volleyball tournament and were doing Great. Xavier had never been in better shape and his form was perfect. Isaac was doing very well if he had to say so himself. So, when Xavier said to come and sit on the Beach Isaac knew he had something serious to say.
‚ÄúIsaac‚Äù Xavier began solemnly, ‚ÄúI love how excited you are for this upcoming tournament‚Äù. ‚ÄúYes Sir‚Äù, Isaac said, cutting him off. ‚ÄúSpring break has been great. The Gold Army Bros are so much Fun!!! The shot contest the other night was fan f**ckingtastic. I‚Äôve had so much fun but I think this Volley Ball tournament will be the cherry on top‚Äù ‚ÄúEspecially after we beat the Caps and any other team that joins‚Äù Isaac added. ‚ÄúThat Is what I need to talk to you about Isaac‚Äù, Xavier continued. ‚ÄúYour enthusiasm is Great but you can‚Äôt go around insulting and putting down the Caps before the game. Being Cocky is good and I love your cocky self but this is a friendly Tournament and the Golden Army, Especially the Caps are our Brothers. You can‚Äôt go around making fun that they will lose. You can be cocky just try and downplay it for the Caps‚Äù ‚ÄúYes Sir‚Äù Isaac said with disappointment in his voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that I know how good we are. I know that THIS is YOUR sport and that you even Refed‚Äù ‚ÄúBut Isaac continued ‚ÄúI will try to tone it down if you say so Sir‚Äù.¬† ‚ÄúGood Boy‚Äù Xavier said.
‚ÄúBut Sir‚Äù Isaac replied, ‚ÄúDoes that mean we don‚Äôt have a chance of winning?‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course not, Boy, We will Kick Ass!! We just shouldn‚Äôt brag about it beforehand.‚Äù Said Xavier with a wink.

Being Gold is all about being the very best, like no one ever was.
That sounds kinda familiar‚Ä¶
Why not combine two of my favorite things into one? I haven‚Äôt thought through what my team would be yet, but it has to be strong. Only the best for the golden army, after all.
What do you say? Up for a quick battle? With every Pokemon you lose, your mind slows down and a piece of clothing comes off. Can you last the whole match?

### Changes: The Perfect Last Minute Prank
Brody hid around the corner, making sure Herc didn't see him coming. It was already past noon on April Fool's Day, and he had no idea what type of prank to pull. Well, that's a lie. He had plenty of ideas. The problem was that none of them were practical at this point. He originally wanted to give out free merch somewhere, transforming those who wore the jerseys into more muscular dumb jocks, but by the time the idea came to be and he went to order them, they wouldn't arrive until after the holiday. Pranking those on the team seemed like an easy choice, but he held power over most of them. It didn't feel quite right to use that power for nefarious purposes.
He was sitting in the Captain's office lamenting over his lack of targets when Herc walked in, a frustrated look on his face. Seems like he wasn't having any luck either.
Brody's eyes lit up. Of course! Herc was the perfect target! The two were equal in power and Brody knew his routine down to the minute. An idea formed in his head. It was quick, harmless, and should get a good laugh. Now he just had to set his plan into motion.
Herc sulked into the Golden Army break room, eager for his afternoon tea. Coming up with the perfect prank was rather hard, and he knew any problem could be solved with a cuppa. Old habits die hard for a Brit.
On his favorite table lay a shiny golden tea kettle, steam still coming out. A crystal clear tea cup sat on a small plate, already filled with his favorite brew. It smelled really good. A note in familiar handwriting caught his attention.
Hey bro,
I saw you looked rather down when you came into our office earlier. Hope this helps cheer you up! A splash of milk and two sugars, just how you like it.
-Brody
That sap. The two knew each other so well. He'd have to return the favor soon. He lifted up the cup, took in the aroma again, and sipped his tea.
And promptly spit it out. It tasted like crap! There definitely wasn't any sugar in this at all. Nope, but there sure was...
Brody came out of his hiding spot, laughing his ass off. That's it. He'd definitely need to repay the favor now.
"The ol' salt and sugar switch. Classic prank, bruv."
"Thanks, bro. Don't worry. I made you an actual cup of tea too. I wouldn't leave you without like that."
Herc scoffed but still took the cup from Brody. It really was just how he liked it. "You know this means I've gotta get ya back, right?"
Brody let out a laugh, a sly grin on his face.
"You can certainly try, bro."

### Changes: Mistaken Identity‚Ä¶ or Planned Transformation?
It started with a laugh‚Äî"What if we swapped jerseys and polos for the day?"
So we did.
Golden Bro 046 wore the drone‚Äôs polished black polo, while Polo Drone 046 stepped into a reflective golden jersey. Thought it was a joke. But Hive systems didn‚Äôt agree.
Suddenly, the golden jersey started syncing with Hive frequencies‚Ä¶ The rubber polo began pulsing with golden core signals‚Ä¶
And in a blur of light and rubber, we both triggered a temporary sync-over.
Now there's a golden drone and a rubber bro‚Äîidentities swapped, minds partially crossed, both trying to walk straight while their suits ‚Äúrecalibrate.‚Äù
The prank got out of hand.
But no one's complaining.
Except maybe the protein shake we laced with glitter.
‚ö†Ô∏è One prank. One mix-up. One golden moment.
They thought it was a joke.
A quick jersey swap.
A laugh in the locker room.
But the energy doesn‚Äôt lie. The transformation never stays temporary.
Now he‚Äôs in rubber. He‚Äôs in gold.
And neither‚Äôs going back.
This April Fool‚Äôs, don‚Äôt just laugh‚Äîtransform.
Join the Golden Army and discover who you become when the game flips and the gear locks on.

### Changes: Golden Bloom: The Submission Season of Brock 46
He wasn‚Äôt planning on stopping.
Brock had run this path a hundred times. Cherry blossoms were blooming‚Äîwhatever. Pretty, pink, useless. His shirt clung to his chest, sweat blooming like ink on fabric. The earbuds were in, beat pumping. Just another run.
But something felt‚Ä¶ off.
The air was warmer. Thicker. Every inhale tugged deeper into his lungs, like the scent was pulling him from the inside out. The petals weren‚Äôt just drifting‚Äîthey were glowing. A pulse of soft light shimmered over the grass. Brock blinked.
One of the petals touched his arm.
It burned.
Not in pain. In‚Ä¶ sensation. A slow spread of warmth climbed from his skin, threading under the surface like gold vines blooming beneath muscle. His steps slowed. Chest rising. Eyes wide. The music in his ears fuzzed‚Äîthen cut. Silence.
Then a hum.
Low. Rhythmic. Almost‚Ä¶ chanting.
His heart pounded to its beat.
He looked down.
Veins of light shimmered along his collarbone, branching up his neck. Golden. Luminous. Beautiful.
Another breath. And his eyes began to glow.
Brock tried to move.
But his legs wouldn‚Äôt obey.
Every breath filled him with more of that heady gold-sweet scent. It wasn‚Äôt oxygen anymore‚Äîit was something richer. Something designed. The air buzzed through his bloodstream like static, filling every nerve with electric command.
Muscles twitched.
His shirt tore at the seams as his back expanded. His arms pulsed, veins glowing with radiant gold beneath the skin, illuminating the network of blooming transformation threading outward like roots. The cherry blossoms above him pulsed in sync.
Then his skin cracked.
Light burst outward. Not blood. Not pain.
Gold.
Brock gasped. The sound wasn't human anymore‚Äîit was deeper, resonant, laced with a low growl of power. His chest flexed, pecs swelling visibly, his abs hardening into gleaming marble beneath the petals clinging to his damp skin.
And through the haze‚Ä¶
The voice returned.
"Bloom harder, bro."
He obeyed.
Skin gave way to radiant plates of living metal. Not armor‚Äîflesh. His entire body rebuilding in waves of shimmering heat. Every muscle was perfect. Every vein, gold-laced. Every breath, deeper than the last.
He looked at his hands.
Not hands. Instruments of purpose.
Fists of obedience.
The light surged outward.
Brock‚Äôs golden body trembled. The change wasn‚Äôt done‚Äîit was accelerating.
His breath came deep, slow. Controlled. Not by him.
By the Gold.
He tried to think, but thought had no space.
Only blooming.
Only submission.
He dropped to his knees as the last layer of flesh was overtaken, every cell transmuted into radiant gold. No more seams. No more sweat. Just smooth, solid perfection. The scent of cherry blossoms fused with gold in the air‚Äîoverwhelming, divine, final.
The petals pulsed brighter.
And from the grove around him, others approached. Dozens.
Hundreds.
Golden Bros, blooming in unison. Some still mid-change, muscles twitching as the floral code rewrote them. Others fully complete‚Äîkneeling in reverence beneath the golden boughs.
One by one, they bowed their heads.
Brock rose.
He stood taller than before. Stronger. Glowing.
His eyes lit‚Äîbeams of gold piercing the sakura haze. Not just reflecting the sun‚Äîradiating it.
He had bloomed.
He had obeyed.
He was no longer Brock 46.
He was a beacon. A Golden God.
‚ÄúWe are gold.
We obey.
We bloom.‚Äù
The grove pulsed with energy.
Gold shimmered across the bodies of the kneeling bros‚Äîbut something new was stirring.
A sheen. A shift. A shimmer of pink.
Brock‚Äôs golden form stood centered in the bloomstorm, eyes aglow, body perfected‚Äîyet not complete.
The petals had not stopped.
They swirled thicker. Glowed brighter.
And as they touched his radiant skin, they didn‚Äôt bounce off.
They melted in.
Flesh refracted‚Äîgold shifting, reframing, gleaming now with pink luminescence.
The cherry blossom‚Äôs final gift. Not just obedience. Not just perfection.
Elegance. Submission. Beauty.
The crowd around him gasped.
Kneeling bros looked up‚Äîpink shimmer crawling across their limbs, their chests, their minds.
Brock‚Äôs lips parted, soft breath escaping as the final transformation locked in.
Not just Gold.
Pink Gold.
The floral override was complete.
And Brock didn‚Äôt resist.
He embraced.
Muscles flexed under the dual glow.
His golden shorts shimmered like polished candy.
Eyes blazed with devotion.
Behind him, more bros fell into line‚Äîkneeling under the cherry blossoms, ready.
Waiting.
One voice spoke aloud‚Äîhis voice‚Äîbut no longer entirely his:
‚ÄúObedience Season‚Ä¶ complete.
All bros bloom.
All bros obey.‚Äù
This spring, the blossoms don‚Äôt just fall‚Äîthey convert.
Cherry petals drift softly through the air‚Ä¶ but one touch is enough.
Your body changes. Your mind aligns. Your purpose awakens.
Muscles tighten. Thoughts dissolve. Gold floods your veins.
And before you even realize what‚Äôs happening,
you‚Äôre kneeling beneath the trees with the rest of the Bros‚Äîgrinning dumb, golden, and obedient.
üå∏ Join the Bloom. Flex for Glory. Obey for Gold.
No resistance. No fear. Only beauty, strength, and sweet submission beneath the blossoms.
üìç Now activating floral conversion zones worldwide.
One sniff. One step. One drop. That‚Äôs all it takes.
üëü Jog in. üå∏ Breathe deep. üíõ Kneel proud.
You were meant to bloom.
Need help adjusting to your golden glow?
Experiencing early blooming symptoms‚Äîflex surges, obedience fog, cherry blossom cravings?

### Changes: Cherry Blossom Memories
"And you're a cherry blossom, you're about to bloom. You look so pretty but you're gone so soon." - Centuries, Fall Out Boy
With Spring upon us once again and recruitment slowing down a little, I've taken up a new hobby while in the off season. Gardening is quite relaxing, actually. Just sitting in the dirt by yourself, reflecting on all that has happened and what is to come. A bit mindless at times (almost reminding me of the polo drones in some ways), but you still need to be in the moment to treat the plants with the care they deserve.
This cherry blossom tree is my latest project. Flowers and vegetables are okay and pleasing in their own way, but they never last. Their time is too short to be truly enjoyed. But a tree on the other hand, that will last much longer.
I know my time with the Golden Army is limited myself, and what will happen then? What will my legacy be? Who will remember me, and what will they remember me for? My role as Captain, maybe? Or as a recruiter, encouraging and "encouraging" bros to become one of us. The time I made the team stay after soccer practice one night to clean the locker room after they'd made a mess of things and I felt bad for the janitors who would have cleaned it? Only time will tell.
I just want to be remembered. I want people telling their kids and grandkids about me and my time with the Golden Army. I don't want to be like the flowers, being left behind in the past so the new generation can blossom. I want to stick around as long as I can. I want to be like this tree.
Sure, the cherry blossoms themselves are short-lived, but the tree itself will be around for a while. By planting this tree at the Golden Army practice field, I hope to leave a legacy for those to come.

Current Captains/Drone Captains include:

Golden Bros who aren't drones currently have the ability to give directives to drones in the form of asking for assistance. Drones should comply, if able.
All drones are equal, aside from Drone Caps. "Level 2" drones and drones with roles may offer guidance or directives when needed, but no drones should feel superior or inferior.
"Level 2" drones will have stricter rules enforcement, but all drones (including Caps and management) are still expected to complete physical and mental training, adhere to drone speech protocols, and complete the weekly prompt along with any additional prompts given by Drone Caps or the Hive.
