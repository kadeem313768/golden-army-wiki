### Guidelines for contribution to the GASL
To unify the outlook of the Golden Army Story Library, here are some of the guidelines, that should be followed whenever a new story is added to the collection.
This is only necessary so that the huge amount of data that enters into the Library can enter in a systematic manner, and thus the principle of transparency can be relied on in future sorting and searching.
The Story Library's structure is a two-stage sorting system. On the main page are only listed the authors of the stories. Those team members, who didn't write anything are not presented on that list.
From the main page each individual writer's stories can be reached. (For example: Stories of PDU-001)
On these sites links to their various stories can be reached.
On these sites stories are divided into smaller subgroups.
Pictures can't be pasted directly into the Story Article, they must be uploaded to the wiki first. You can upload pictures (and other files) here. Please note that the file limit is 10 MB.
The picture name should be named precisely. The destination filename's first part should include the author's name (like: Isaac Gold), and the name's second part should reflect the subgroup the story is in. Currently there are 3 subgroups: A00; ZSA00; PAA00. Always use the last free available subgroup designation. (So for example if the latest designation is C12, you should use C13, and not C01 or B92)
The A00 image name is reserved for profile pictures.
Story subgroups:
So in the end you should end up with something like these:
PDU-094 A88.jpg, Brody Gold PAR67.png, Brock Gold ZSO76.webm
Use the [[Category:Storypictures]] in the summary to automatically add to the right category.
License: use the "This is licensed under another free license." option.
It is recommended to uncheck the option to watch that file.
In the story you can use this template to paste the picture more smoothly.

### Getting Started
(home)
Welcome to the Golden Army‚Äîa place where brotherhood, transformation, and self-improvement come together. Whether you're here to become a strong, dumb jock, a supportive teammate, or a focused polo-drone, this page will guide you through your first steps in the Army.

### Golden Army Recruitment
(home) (gold in practice)
When you find prospective recruits for the Golden Army, you can chat with them a bit to tell them what we are about from your point of view‚Ä¶ If some are just commenting on your blog or saying "hey",  try to drops hint of conversion to see if they are interested. People might need enticing and a lot of our story are about getting drawn to gold by another gold bro, so people contacting you might be expecting that.
If the potential recruit seems really interested, direct them to a Golden recruiter¬†: PDU-001, Cap Brody or Cap Herc (susceptible to change¬†: see [Organisation] for current recruiters).
Recruiters will handle the recruit and perform the Gold Brocess on them, getting them their Gold Kit, gold name and number. Prospective recruit can join as players, waterboys or mascot.
Once brocessed a new Gold Bro is born and must connect with the Team.
New Gold bro, whether they are players, water boys or mascots enter a two-week try-out period and get assigned a mentor by the recruiters. It is a period to check their motivation and help them really integrate the team and connect with their new bros as Gold Bros. A period to focus on core Gold values and explore being a player / waterways / mascot.
At the end of these two week, they will become full-fledged Gold Bro. They will be asked to fill a survey by Quality assessment liaison and to commit to not leave the Gold without at least explaining why to the Caps.
As full Gold Bros, they can now take part in other subgroup, such as the pole-drones, if they choose to. They can also be called upon to be mentors for other entrants.
Mentor are assigned to guide and help new bros integrating well in the Gold, helping them understand the communication tools, giving them the informations and pushing them to connect with other bros, either through the different rooms or through direct connections with some of their Brother. Mentor also listen to their mentoree‚Äôs concerns and report useful feedback to Management.

or
The external image is important to us, as we are taking on more and more members in both the Gold Brothers and the Polo Drones and also optimizing their lives.
Of course, we also must be present in the media. However, it is not enough to have a profile for the Gold Bros and the Polo Drones. Every member of the Golden Army, whether Gold Bro or PDU, should have their own Tumblr profile. Other social media profiles are welcome but should then also be based on the layout guidelines.
The purpose of the profile is to blog your own Golden Army posts, but also to reblog the posts of other Gold Army members. (More precise rules are given in the relevant articles.) By distributing our blogs in this way, we achieve a higher level of awareness.
It is also important that the profile pages have a uniform or at least similar appearance.
Other elements on the way to our goal: Tags and Recruitment Block.
By following these guidelines, we ensure that our content is consistent, effective and reaches as many people as possible.

### Golden Army FAQ
(home) (Getting started)
This is a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page for the Golden Army. This is meant to answer questions new members may have, but can also be utilized by existing members.
The Golden Army is a roleplaying group founded by Captain Richard in 2024. It primarily focuses around sports, but sports aren‚Äôt the only things we do. We focus on brotherhood and connections, trying to help our bros build bonds and be the best person they can be.
Yes, we do have resources to buy golden jerseys in real life. We don‚Äôt require members to buy or purchase anything. We do try to encourage team members to make healthier life choices, but we don‚Äôt require it.
We try to keep our rules minimal, the main things are:
Yes, as long as you understand and comprehend English somewhat and can hold conversations in English. We try to encourage the team not to use slang, jargon, or colloquiums that could confuse non-native speakers. We also embrace the diversity of the team with worldwide language chats to help your fellow bros learn your language and culture.
First, players and drones have different expectations.
Prompts are topics we want the team, players, or drones to make content for in the form of images, stories, and captions.
See the [Chat Rooms] page.
We are currently working on adding tutorials for some of the image generators we most commonly use like Bing, Microsoft Designer, and Leonardo.Ai

### Resources

### Chat rooms
(home) (gold in practice)
Telegram is organised around the Golden Team group. This is the most active part currently. Since we have a lot of members who are often chatty, it can get overwhelming at times, which is the reason why Topics were introduced. The idea behind this is to allow everyone to let go of some topics  without feeling that they are missing out on too much. It is really recommended to mute the channels you do not want to follow actively. It does not prevent you from getting there to see what's going on, but you might just tire out if trying to follow everything. Topics are there to help us not follow everything, and to reduce confusion. This page tries to explain what channels are supposed to be for what. Of course, there are sometimes digressions, but try to avoid doing too many of them, if you can. What you should check from time to time are the pinned post, especially in the main channel. They are usually pinned for a reason...
Rather than reading all logs, it is ok to ask 'What happened¬†?'. When people do, if you're in, try to answer, with a real answer¬†: not just 'nothing much', even if that how you feel, but rather 'not a lot¬†: we had some chitchat about Wicked and some people talked about gaming and what they like'.

### RP etiquette


### Drone RP
Drone RP can be more tricky because it requires maintaining the collective mindset‚Äîuniformity in thought, behavior, and appearance. Distinctiveness is to be suppressed as much as possible to embody the collective‚Äôs purpose, and it is not easy to do. So here are some advices and strategies to help embodying a polo-drone in RP:

### Weekly Prompts
(home)(groups)(golden team)
Each week, the Golden Army shares a new Theme‚Äîa prompt designed to inspire creativity and connection through posts, pictures, or stories.
Whether it‚Äôs a full transformation tale, a captioned image, or just a vibe you want to share, weekly prompts are a great way to engage with the team and show how Gold flows through you.
Each prompt is announced in #announcements, usually with a title and a few ideas for how to interpret it. But feel free to get creative‚Äîthere‚Äôs no single ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way to explore a theme. A hashtag is also shared to help group the posts together.
Let the prompts fuel your transformation, inspire your RP, and strengthen your bond with the team.
Glitches erased. Obedience uploaded. This week, dive into GOLD TECH.
Explore the seductive side of futuristic upgrades: AI trainers, neural implants, golden circuits under the skin, techno-hypnosis spirals, or advanced conditioning and muscle growth tools.
Some Suggestions : A locker room where uniforms self-tighten and gasmasks download commands. A drone maintenance facility where minds are wiped and replaced with gold-coded routines. A tech startup run by Gold Bros to mass-produce perfectly programmed players.
You can go more metaphoric: gold tech might representing the mental shift towards pure discipline, the "upgrade" from chaotic thought to streamlined obedience, or play with contrasts: rugged jocks turned into sleek, rubber-clad drones. Preppy interns seduced by perfect software. Chavs turned into Bluetooth-linked drone units.
Everything must serve the Golden Army. Every update pushes deeper. Every glitch must be patched.
Hashtag: #GoldTech

### Official Matches
(home)(groups)(golden team)
Welcome to the battlefield, Gold Bro. Official matches are more than just competition‚Äîthey are the ultimate test of our strength, discipline, and unity. When a match is announced, it‚Äôs not just about playing a sport; it‚Äôs about proving that the Golden Team is the best. Whether it‚Äôs on the field, in the gym, or through sheer willpower, every action you take brings us closer to victory.
This is your chance to showcase the dominance of the Gold enArmy in various sports, to push yourself to new limits, and to contribute to something bigger than yourself. As we train, prepare, and hype up the battle, the entire team is watching. Every rep, every story, every image fuels the energy of the squad.
And when the final whistle blows, and the match unfolds, you‚Äôll see the results of our collective effort‚Äînot just in the score, but in the way we stand together, united, unstoppable.
Official matches bring the Golden Army together around a common goal for a set period. Each match tests the team‚Äôs dedication, preparation, and engagement, both physically and through storytelling.
Matches are discussed by Management, who decide on the next event. Occasionally, polls will be held on Telegram or Discord to let the team vote on which sport should be showcased next.
Once a sport is chosen, the match context (e.g., friendly meet, tournament, championship) is set, and an official announcement is posted, marking the start of the preparation period and setting the deadline for point tallies.
Once a match is announced, the Gold Team must prepare by earning points through workouts and posts. Every effort helps push the team closer to victory.
At the end of the preparation period, all points are tallied to determine:
Once the results are finalized, the match is written up and illustrated (this can take between one day and one week).
When everything is ready, one or more official stories are posted on the Golden Army Tumblr, detailing the flow of the match, highlighting key moments, and showcasing the MVPs of the game.
Every effort‚Äîevery push-up, every post, every share‚Äîbrings the Golden Army closer to victory. Whether you‚Äôre playing, training, or hyping the team, your role matters.
When we win, we win together. When we fight, we fight as one. Are you ready to make history?

### Members

The most up-to date list of members and their position can be found in the Roster of the Golden Army
This page is for members to create and link a personal page for them. Typically a personal page can have an description and your gold bro persona and his personal lore/history if any (like other forms and such) as well as an IRL introduction section to tell us more about your interest or things likes that. You are perfectly free to create your page and edit this one to link it here. To create a personal page, select create new page in the menu and name it with your main persona's name: like Franco Gold, Scott Gold, or when the name is not your Golden name, like Maximus' case, name it the correct way, like PDU-070 or PDU-039.
This page always contains the currently active members list.

### 9- Herc
To be filled
Position (soccer):
Cap of the Golden Army.

### Daniel/Fenrir
Daniel is an Irish jock from Cork, Ireland. He currently resides in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland.
Position (soccer): Midfielder, Jersey #16
Daniel was initially recruited by Cap Brody.
His polo-drone personality emerged under Scott/009/Drone-Cap 3 009, shortly after his arrival.
During a moment of tension, Scott got brainwashed by a spiral and Daniel/016 went on a quest to reforge Gleipnir to deliver Scott and protect him from further attacks.
To forge a new one, the dwarves had to free Fenrir from the old Gleipnir and as Fenrir could not be left to roam free, Daniel accepted to be bound to Fenrir forever, becoming his host.
Fenrir lends wild traits to Daniel/016 and is resistant to most of the Polo-drone mental training.
As a result, Daniel/016's top is corrupted, neither Gold Jersey nor Black Rubber, but Gold Rubber.
Yet to develop.

### Polo-drone Guidelines
(home)(groups)(polo-drones)
To Be Developed.
Guidelines on polo-drone RP can be found here

### Being a Gold Bro
(home)(groups)(golden team)
The Golden Team is the heart of the Golden Army‚Äîa vibrant brotherhood of jocks, athletes, mascots, and waterboys all united by one goal: to push ourselves and each other to be better, stronger, louder, prouder.
To be a Gold Bro means to embrace the GOLD mindset:
Whether you're on the field, in the stands, or behind the scenes, you're part of something greater. A force built on unity, transformation, and drive.

### The Gold Kit
(home)(groups)(golden team)
The Gold Kit is more than gear‚Äîit's a rite of passage.
It is given during the Brocess, marking the moment a bro embraces his true Gold identity. The moment his old self fades, and his Golden self shines through.
It‚Äôs not just something you wear.
It‚Äôs something you become.

### Past matches
(home)(groups)(gold)(matches)

### Gold Mascots
(home)(groups)(golden team)
The Golden Army‚Äôs mascots are an essential part of the team‚Äôs identity, bringing energy, intimidation, and team spirit to every game. Whether rallying the home crowd, shaking up the opponent‚Äôs morale, or dazzling fans with acrobatics, the mascots are just as important as the players on the field.
There are three primary mascots, each with a unique role and personality:
The Golden Knight is the main and most recognizable mascot of the Golden Army. Clad in shimmering gold armor, this noble figure embodies the strength, resilience, and discipline of the team. The imposing presence of the Knight is a symbol of tradition and honor, rallying fans and players alike before battle.
When the Golden Army takes the fight to away games, they unleash their fiercest symbol: Dorado, the Golden Tiger. Unlike the regal Golden Knight, Dorado is all about intimidation and raw energy.
Beyond the two main figures, a lively squad of energetic mascots‚Äîknown as the Golden Pups and Polo-Drone Pups‚Äîhelp cheer, dance, and hype up the crowd.
Alongside the mascots, the Golden Army‚Äôs Cheerleaders bring an explosive energy to every game. Their sharp routines and synchronized movements ensure that the Golden Army‚Äôs spirit never fades‚Äîno matter the score.
Golden Army Mascots serve a vital purpose beyond entertainment‚Äîthey are an integral part of the team's battle strategy.
Being a mascot is more than just wearing a suit‚Äîit‚Äôs about embodying the spirit of the Golden Army. If you want to step into the Golden Knight‚Äôs armor, prowl as Dorado, or electrify the crowd as a Pup, talk to Grayden or the management team.
Every roar, every cheer, every movement contributes to victory.  Because in the Golden Army, every role matters.
Are you ready to take the stage?

### Soccer
(home)(groups)(golden team)
The Golden Team was built on the field.
Soccer isn‚Äôt just a sport for us‚Äîit‚Äôs a proving ground for discipline, brotherhood, and dominance. It‚Äôs where the Gold Bros train, bond, and rise together. The roar of the crowd, the rhythm of the game, the Gold Kit tight on your body‚Äîthis is where Gold shines the brightest.

### Ice Hockey
(home)(groups)(golden team)
When the ice meets Gold, victory is inevitable.
The Golden Knights, the second official sports team of the Golden Army, bring that same hunger, discipline, and unity from the field onto the rink. This is where brute strength meets sharp precision, and where Gold Bros prove their worth in every shift, every check, and every goal.

### Polo-drone Conversion
(home)(groups)(polo-drones)
Rule: No one becomes a polo drone without first undergoing the brocess. Wannabe drones must join as players, waterboys, or mascots first.
To ensure polo-drones serve the Gold and contribute to the Gold Army, it has become a requirement that only full fledged member of the Gold Team, who have been properly Brocessed intro either a player, a waterboy or a mascot, can be converted to polo-drone, and only after the end of their tryouts. The rubber interacts with the Gold to create a balance that allow complete surrender and mindless bliss. And this period as Gold Team member ensure that polo-drone care for the Team and know the brother they're going to serve and help reach victory. Their gold persona will be erased when becoming polo-drone, but the connections they made will drive them toward unity.
It means that any applicant feeling the pull of the rubber polo must first get the Gold Kit and learn to bond with their brother. They can be players, learning to hone their body and excel on the field, ready to become the best possible players on the pitch once given the focus of mindless obedience. They can be waterboys, learning to serve there bro and provide for them, showing they can serve as human before relinquishing their individuality. They can be mascot, learning to cheer their bro as a supporting squad, before relinquishing all identity and embracing compliant unity.
Rule¬†: During conversion, a polo drone is assigned a number and provided a new profile picture by the recruiter. It must ensure compliant uniformity by using this new PFP and ensuring his social media accounts follow the template.
When a full fledged Gold Bro feel the pull of the rubber polo and decide to join the polo-drone, his previous identity is erased. It becomes a number, always wearing its polo-drone and embracing its new nature. Its former Gold blog is replaced by the polo-drone one as he renounced individuality, personality or thoughts. Mindless obedience and conformance will drive it from now on. This ensures uniformity and consistency for new drones.
Rule: A one-week trial/grace period post-conversion allows new drones to adapt and learn mannerisms. Mistakes during this time carry no judgment or consequences.
Just after conversion, the new polo-drone has a one-week trial/grace period to adapt to polo-drone and learn the drone mannerism. It is a time of adaptation and learning, not of judgement, where we help it integrate and errors have no consequences. During this time, drone must however respect the unity requirement by keeping the pfp it was given at conversion, so that it can understand it has been transformed, and get used to relinquishing choices and obeying as a drone should. The grace period is of course not an excuse for being defiant and undisciplined. Drone are allowed mistake, but must show effort to integrate.
Rule: After the one-week grace period, drones can change their PFP to a personalized version, provided it adheres to the specifications of polo-drone uniforms.
By this time, the polo-drone has accepted its new nature and learned to follows specifications properly. It can thus be trusted to adapt its pfp to an appearance that will reinforce its engagement while respecting all specifications.
Rule: In the Gold Stadium, the rubber polo can recede and let the golden persona or human self reemerge.
When the gold influence is strong, such as in the gold stadium or during training or match, the rubber polo can recede to let the golden bro or human selves reemerge. This means that in the chat-rooms, you can chose to drop drone behaviour and act as your Gold selves or just let the IRL human behind express itself. The polo-drone influence is not fully gone as you might still feel some of the calm, purpose and focus than permeates your existence as a polo-drone.
However, while the power of the Gold is stronger in the Gold stadium and allows former subsumed identities to reemerge for a while, a drone can decide to resist the process by concentrating on the rubber and stay in drone state. So a polo-drone can choose never to let the Gold draw its erased self out. The Gold will still allow them to adopt more human attitude when in need of brotherhood or comfort, or if they need to express mental distress or human feedback.
When you find potential recruits from outside the Team that seems interested in becoming polo-drone, you can tell them that it is a long process, where they have to serve the Gold as human in the Gold Team before to earn the right to convert.  Tease them, check their eagerness, explain the process, talk about your experience, show them the wiki or send them to polo-drone converter (currently PDU-070 or PDU-073) or Gold recruiter (PDU-001 or one of the Cap), so that they can explain them the process and how they first have to be brocessed and join the team as players, waterboys or mascots. You can check the organisation page to check who is recruiter or converter.

### The Gold Influence
(home) (groups)(polo-drones)
The influence of Gold allows for dynamic interactions between the polo-drone state, the Gold Bro persona, and the human host. Indeed, the Gold can force the rubber polo to recede and draw out the Gold Bro persona or the human host personality, overriding when needed the drone programming. This fluidity ensures both the effectiveness of the Hive and the adaptability of its drones in varying circumstances.

### Polo-drone History
(home)(groups)(polo-drone)
There have been rumors of the polo-drone existing before it joined with the Gold Team, and taking over a whole neighborhood called Maple Height, or converting customers at The Pulse nightclub to help with security, but little is known for sure. Was it another Hive¬†? are they part of the Collective¬†?
What is known for sure is that at some point, Cap Richard Gold, frustrated by some slips in the Gold Team performance, came upon the rubber polo-drone. The power of the black rubber and that of the Gold jersey somehow combined and Cap got the means to start the Collective as it is now. Cap had realized that as a team, the Gold Army wasn‚Äôt presenting a proper united front. Everyone had different opinions, profiles and there was a general lack of focus. He decided that he needed a core group of loyal, mindless and obedient players to keep the Team strong. He devised a reeducation program to convert willing players into polo-drones, with a new uniformed look and no personality getting in the way of Unity, letting them focus on emptying their mind, enjoying the freedom from thought and doing as they‚Äôre told.
It started slowly and out of the spotlight, the week before Halloween, with some first conversions like the ones of 055, 011, 033 and 031. Gold bros were uncertain of what was happening and it was a period of uncertainty. Some were worried that Cap might have changed, wondering what was his intention, some were jealous of the new drone, upset of being left out of what they knew would be a big change in the Gold Team. Those who felt the pull of the rubber polo were yearning to get one, sometimes getting frustrated with the wait. Others were worrying that they might be made to join forcefully, or that the warm brotherhood and welcoming atmosphere of the Gold Team might be lost to something cold and mechanical. Golden Future looked incertain.
One of the most trusted and active bro of the Gold Team, Herc, appeared one day in a rubber polo, converted to 009 and he tried to show its Gold brothers that even as a polo-drone, he was still himself, that they should all trust Cap. That is when, 070, writing this log, joined the Collective and gained more clarity, along with some others like 051, 065, 017 or 008. Slowly, over Halloween, harmony came back as it became obvious that converted polo-drone still cared about their Gold bros. Their erased former self remerging in the Gold stadium and on the field as the polo-drone receded from the Gold in those places, as 009 had been explaining all along.
Polo-drone reinforced their training in the drone-room under the guidance of Cap and the Hive gained in Unity. But recruitment was stalled as Cap was kept busy by external circumstances. Finally, Cap Richard told his most trusted lieutenant, 009 and Brody, that he needed them to take a more active role in leading the group when he was occupied, and named them Interim co-Captains. Even if he does not intervene directly, Cap is still in touch with the Collective to this day and his distant Presence looming above us gives us all purpose.
As the Interim Cap got hold of the rubber polo and the conversion procedure, recruitment resumed and the Collective started to grow again. While until now, only Gold Bros had been converted, conversion was now open to applicants from everywhere, who could join directly as drones to serve the Gold as polo-drones. Even out of the field, the drive and focus experienced by the polo-drone could be useful to the Gold Army, especially given that the original administrative drone Percival, which was handling so much for the Team, had become a player over Halloween and water boys were not as present. These new drones were typically given numbers above 100. And with the conversion running again, and the new drone sharing the bliss of their state, many Gold Bros joined the Collective.
This is the state we were when this page was first created. With the rapid increase of the community, it became obvious that there was a need for some compiled and shared information to avoid chaos and ensure a common ground for all polo-drone and this is how the document came to be.
During the ensuing period, many new polo-drone were converted and as the Hive grew, and more Gold bros felt the pull of the rubber polo, thing became unbalanced. Despite polo-drone 108 being named as Commander for the polo-drone,  there was confusion in the chain of commands as polo-drone required more rigid structure than what the gold brotherhood of the Gold Team was used to. Some space were created to allow each group to express its specificities more strongly without blurring the values of each other, but balance was difficult to find. In the end, Cap Herc, also known as polo-drone 009 brought up a new leader for the polo-drone, to make them into a true unified Hive. SIR came in and gave new purpose and direction to the Hive, giving it more autonomy and establishing clearer boundaries that also allowed the Gold Team to recenter to its purpose. This was a new chapter for the polo drones, a step further in becoming a United Hive, though it was a short one. Polo-drone were refer to as Polo-Drone-Unit and new processes were put in place under PDU-SIR, ensuring more daily activities and training. However, that leadership was short-lived as PDU-SIR did not feel at ease with the contraints of the Gold Army and the dichotomy of a drone-hive being part of the Gold. He left suddenly to found his own group, leaving the group in disarray for a bit.
Following that, the Polo-Drone-Hive recentered on its original purpose and it was decided to stop direct external recruitment. Those who feel the pull of the rubber now have to join the Gold Army first before being converted and the links between polo-drone and Gold Team are stronger than ever. The Hive improved to ensure consistent daily training, new spiral and hypnofiles. To allow drone to go deeper into training and accountability, lvl 2 drone program was designed and brought forth.

### Polo-drones
(home)(groups)(polo-drone)
A polo-drone is calm, focused and disciplined. Its posture is straighter, its attention never wandering. Its expression is eerily serene as its mind is still and quiet¬†: buzzing thoughts are gone and the thoughts that are left are no longer his own.
This focus and discipline makes the polo-drone quiet and efficient. It is more measured, and its tone is more reserved, all mechanical and robotic. It does not do superfluous talk or movement. Being precise and directed.
Polo-drones display a quiet authority that comes from knowing they are a part of something bigger. They are deliberate, with a firm gaze. They belong. The collective has given them¬† purpose and clarity about their role. They must obey and serve. They are driven to recruit others and be the best version of themselves they can be, becoming better players for the Gold Team or efficient tools for ensuring that Gold continues to shine and win, that the Collective thrives.
Mindless obedience is a core truth of the polo-drones. They are controlled at all times. They exist to obey Cap and the Collective, to serve the Gold Army. They are utterly loyal and when in presence of a controller, eagerly awaiting orders. Obedience is absolute and automatic.
Unity is another core tenet of the polo-drones. Compliant unity brought forth by perfect uniformity. Polo-drones are identical in appearance and thought. They can feel each other in the Collective as they share a common purpose. Mutual understanding is reinforced and polo-drones are perfectly synchronized. Their previous identity has been erased and all distinctiveness must be discarded. They have no name, only a number. All in the same uniform, with no personality quirks or mannerism. They strive to embody this Unity in their appearance, their movements and their speech pattern.
New polo-drone observe the speech-pattern of trained polo-drone to mold their expression on this model. Agreeing and repeating, over and over. It feels natural to follow and obey. Being in uniform feels right. The polo-drone can feel their uniform locked in as something permanent.
Unity and Obedience provides the polo-drone with a blissful sense of quiet satisfaction. Everything is as it should be. Obeying orders brings pleasure, being mindless brings serenity, following polo-drone brothers feels natural and right. Polo-drones derive deep pleasure and contentment from being united with the Collective.
A polo-drone former appears more distant and indifferent. Identity has been erased and it identifies itself by its number to its deeper core, but its memories remain. While this previous identity has faded and been subsumed into the Collective, it can still be accessed to¬† run human emulation. A polo-drone still cares about those it was close to, especially its Gold Bros. It wants to be reunited in the collective with those it loves, but is able to refrain from this drive in order to respect his Gold bros choices. He is capable of analyzing the reaction of humans and reacting accordingly, but his focus and discipline always allow it to put some distance if needed. Echos of its previous self occasionally stir inside when triggered but they can be quickly silenced by the gas mask when it is wearing it.
The first duty of a polo-drone is to maintain itself in perfect condition. It has to train its mind and body to become a better player, a better tool. It must keep its body in perfect condition, using its focus and discipline to eat properly and work out regularly. It must also train its mind regularly, going into the drone room to train with the spirals, and spend some time in mindless bliss as its programming is reinforced.
Second, polo-drones have a duty to their polo-drone brothers as they must support them in their crisis and encourage them to become even better drones, to follow the rules, obey and behave. Ensuring uniformity of mind and behavior by following obedient-drones, agreeing and repeating, or by being role models of obedience and discipline.
Polo-drone also have a duty to the Gold Army and their gold bros. Players participate in team training and matches on the field and even non-players provide help and support. These generally occur in the Gold stadium where the Gold Kit can take over the rubber polo and allow the polo-drone to bond with their Gold Bros. Teamwork is important and the synchronicity and focus of the polo-drone on the field helps even non drone players to become better and more driven.
At last, Polo-drone have a duty to spread the word of the collective and the Gold, searching new recruits or luring them by posting stories and pictures. On Tumbler, polo-drone always share the posts of their fellow polo-drone and of their Gold Bros to expand the reach of the Gold Army.
Between its duty, a polo-drone goes around the day with focus, discipline and purpose. Polo drone conserve autonomy and can act proactively to fulfill their purpose. It can choose to enjoy some more time in the drone room, donning its gas mask to reach deep dronespace, a state of pure mindless obedience where the drone can only do what it is told, initiate or repeat mantra or otherwise be on standby, absorbing programming from the spiral. It can also decide to serve or connect with its brothers in the Gold team chats (Golden Team and Golden Team RP). There it can choose to let his former personality reemerge for idle chat or brobonding, or it can maintain a deeper drone mindset to interact with them as a drone (see this page for advice on RP as drone), assisting them by its advice or more physically (or even sexually). It is also there that polo-drone brothers can choose to reinforce each other's program in a more physical manner.
Concerning conversion, polo-drone must remember that only the willing can be optimally converted. Only Drone-converters can handle a conversion and when spotting a willing subject, polo-drone will direct them to one of the drone-converters, or to recruiters if the future drone is not yet part of the Gold Army. Regarding forced conversion, it can appear in fictional stories. Any RP of a forced conversion must ensure beforehand HRP consent.

### Drone speech protocols
(home)(groups)(polo-drones)
Drones must use drone speech in all designated contexts and when acting as a drone.
Drones must use their assigned designation and must avoid first-person pronouns.
Drones must restrict emotional expression to acceptable forms aligned with Hive values.
Drones must communicate efficiently, concisely, and replace human terms with robotic alternatives.
Drones must correct errors during adaptation and reinforce proper behavior with encouragement.

To maximize reach and efficiency, always use these tags (tentative):
You can find out which tags are specified for the posts here.
To further enhance training and integration, the Hive had developed advanced tools accessible to all drones.
Access: Microsoft Designer - AI Image Creator
Purpose: Create high-quality, enticing images that support the Hive's mission.
PDU-999 is our virtual Polo Drone Unit in the Chat-GPT. It is available to answer any questions about the Golden Army. Try it out.
Objective: Reinforce the Hive‚Äôs unity and amplify its influence through calculated and creative outreach.

### Training and enforcement
(home) (groups) (polo-drone)
Training are put in place to allow polo-drone to exert their obedience and immerse in their role as mindless unit, to reinforce unity by having polo-drone executes and report common training. Polo-drones will feel pleasure when accomplishing their task and reporting completion. Remember¬†: Obedience is pleasure. Pleasure is obedience. Other polo-drone must improve unity by reinforcing the pleasure felt by compliant drones, acknowledging their contribution to the collective.
Each daily training contains a mandatory part. To stay connected with the Polo-Drone-Hive and reinforce the collective, polo-drone are required to do them without fault, to learn to surrender a part of their day everyday to their new nature and reinforce it. This mandatory part is kept short to allow management of the external constraint a drone might have because of former obligations. If there are circumstances where even such a small commitment is impossible, polo-drone must find a way to atone and reconnect as soon as possible. If such impossibilities can be anticipated, exceptional exemption might be asked to Caps or fellow drone to account for specific circumstances.
To dwelve deeper into drone state, suggestions are given for additional training. If a polo-drone has no external constraint, it should strive to undertake as much as these suggestions as it can. They will strengthen its obedience and give it pleasure for exceeding minimal expectations.
Polo-drone are expected to move more and more towards the bliss of mindless obedience and perfect compliance. Discipline has to be learned and practiced. If a polo-drone resolve is dwindling, its fellow drone must remind it its duties. Sometimes however, external circumstances might push a drone to feels disconnected and pushing it harder might then yield counterproductive results. In such case, remember that polo-drone originates from a brotherhood. In such case, rather than judge and condemn, fellow drone must support their disconnecting brothers and help them reach a mental state where reconnection is possible and effective.
In case of non-compliance, some atonement or punishment protocols can be called for to help the drone learn discipline. That enforcement is collective and based on a opt-in approach. While the Hive as a whole strive to push each other deeper into dronehood, individual drone might required different touches, and the Hive accept that not every drone host is willing to devote itself fully. One might serve the Gold in many way and explore dronehood not as a deep dive but just as an aspect of Gold among others. Those who want to be held accountable to their training can apply to become lvl 2 drones, but any drone can discuss with the Hive to adjust the level of enforcement it is expecting.

### Polo-Drone Level 2
(home) (groups)(polo-drones)
Level 2 Polo-Drones represent a deeper level of commitment and submission within the Hive. By choosing to advance, these drones embrace stricter accountability, active participation, and unwavering adherence to Hive directives. Their new uniform symbolizes this elevated role, reflecting their dedication to discipline, obedience, and collective unity.
Unlike Level 1 drones, who are guided and nurtured as they adapt to the Hive‚Äôs values, Level 2 drones voluntarily subject themselves to stricter control and more immediate consequences for deviations. Their actions are monitored closely, and any failure to comply is met with appropriate correction. This environment enables Level 2 drones to delve deeper into the satisfaction of mindless obedience, reinforcing their alignment with the Hive‚Äôs ideals while serving as role models for others.
Note however that the Gold Influence continues to operate as it always has. It is not affected by the transition to Level 2.

### PDU Level 2 Requirements
(home) (groups)(polo-drones)(polo-drones lvl2)
To apply for level 2, a polo-drone just have to start filling the daily self report form  and identify itself as applicant for lvl 2 in the form.
It is also recommended to contact polo-drone converters to let them know of the application and announce it in the drone room.
Applicants must demonstrate tangible progress in their transformation, which includes:
Applicants are required to submit daily self-reporting forms, which must document:
To qualify for Level 2 status, the drone must meet these criteria:
Level 2 drones must:
To remain at Level 2, drones must show initiative by contributing to the Hive in at least one of the following ways:

### Obligations and Responsibilities of Level 2 Drones
(home) (groups)(polo-drones)(polo-drones lvl2)
4. Hive rules Enforcement

### Enforcement (Absolute Unity)
(home) (groups)(polo-drones)(polo-drones lvl2)
Level 2 drones are held to stricter standards of discipline and compliance, with stronger enforcement to ensure alignment with Hive principles. Any deviation from the rules may result in punishment, strikes, or even demotion, emphasizing the importance of maintaining accountability.
Absolute unity enforcement principle demands unwavering discipline, where errors result in correction or punishment to reinforce submission and compliance. This philosophy ensures Level 2 drones maintain their advanced status and serve as examples of perfection, embodying the principles of obedience, discipline, and collective strength. Proper compliance and obedience  automatically bring pleasure to the drone, but can still be reinforced by recognition and praise.
Punishments are administered by Drone Caps, Management, fellow Level 2 drones, or through the Drone Activity Monitor. Punishments escalate based on the severity and frequency of the offense:

### Polo-Drone Uniform and Uniformity
(home)(groups)(polo-drones)
Uniform is not just clothing.
For a Polo-Drone, it is a trigger, a signal, a tool, and a statement.
When a drone puts on its uniform, it activates its mindset. It leaves behind confusion and choice, slipping into clarity, control, and compliance. The uniform transforms the wearer into a tool of the Hive, ready to serve and obey.

### Polo-drone Power Structure
(home) (groups) (polo-drone)
This page is about the power structures in the Polo drone hive.
Current Captains/Drone Captains include:
Current non-captain management members include:
Golden Bros who aren't drones currently have the ability to give directives to drones in the form of asking for assistance. Drones should comply, if able.
All drones are equal, aside from Drone Caps. "Level 2" drones and drones with roles may offer guidance or directives when needed, but no drones should feel superior or inferior.
"Level 2" drones will have stricter rules enforcement, but all drones (including Caps and management) are still expected to complete physical and mental training, adhere to drone speech protocols, and complete the weekly prompt along with any additional prompts given by Drone Caps or the Hive.

### Content Check
(home) (gold in practice)
The content check is designed to ensure that social media profiles and posts comply with the Golden Army‚Äôs guidelines.
The purpose of the checks is to increase the awareness of the Golden Army with its Golden Team and the Polo Drone Units and to recruit new members. To do this, it is crucial that certain rules are strictly adhered to when designing social media profiles and blog entries.You can find more information about the purpose, the layout of the profile pages and the guidelines for posts here.
If you want to take some work off our hands and avoid unpleasant messages from us, read the articles carefully, follow the guidelines and adjust your profile and blog entries accordingly if necessary.
As there are currently too few content checkers available, the checks are only carried out randomly. In the future, we plan to check every article and every profile.
The content checkers will check your profiles and blog entries and evaluate their components. If they do not meet the requirements, you will receive a message asking you to correct the profile or entry. The faster you implement the changes, the better.
If you send the responsible checker a message about the changes you have made, they can carry out the check and give you feedback - either that an error has crept in and the procedure will start again, or that everything is now OK.
If you do not provide any feedback, the content checkers will check the element in question again approximately 7 days later.
The checks must be documented in the relevant content check lists. Only management and the content checkers have access to these lists.The content check distinguishes between two checks:
There are two lists for documentation in which the respective check is documented from start to finish.
If the requirements are not met, a follow-up check is planned.The lists are designed in such a way that they indicate in color whether and which follow-up checks are pending.
To ensure that a user is not accidentally checked multiple times at the same time, it must be checked in advance whether there is already an open check for the corresponding profile. (content check lists)The profile must be called up and the individual elements checked using the "Layout" checklist.
These contacts must also be documented.However, in the case of follow-up checks, the last check date is overwritten.
There is currently no further escalation level, but one has been requested from management.
Which articles are checked?
The content checkers use the latest entries in the Golden Social Media Promos Room (TG) or social media sharing (discord) as a guide.To ensure that an article is not accidentally checked multiple times at the same time, it must be checked in advance whether there is already an open check for the entry in question. (content check lists)The entry must be called up and the individual elements checked using the "Posts" checklist.
These contacts must also be documented.However, the last check date is overwritten during follow-up checks.
There is currently no further escalation level, but one has been requested from management.
